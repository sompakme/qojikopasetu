The following day, The Kid Laroi and Smith, who performs under his stage name Jaden, made waves at the Encore Beach Club, performing to a sold-out crowd.</p><p>The 18-year-old “Without You” singer kept the party going on Friday with a pop-up performance at Delilah. Diehard Justin supporters were also able to enjoy a takeover at the acclaimed AREA15, which gave attendees the chance to take in musical performances while enjoying a skate competition, one of his favorite sports.</p><p>While the event was completely curated by Justin, the star sightings didn’t stop with his crew. The Chainsmokers (<strong>Alex Pall</strong> and <strong>Drew Taggart</strong>) were seen enjoying a meal at the Mexican coastal concept restaurant, Casa Playa, in the Wynn. Kehlani also dined at the new celeb hot spot in the adjacent private dining room on Saturday, October 9.</p><p>The main event, however, was when Justin took the stage for his 60-minute set at 1 a.m. local time at XS Nightclub to perform hits including “Yummy,” “What Do You Mean,” “Intentions” and “Peaches.” His performance of “Ghost” was fresh off the release of the music video with <a href=#><strong>Diane Keaton</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Denise-Truscello-_-Getty-Images-1.jpg><p>“Vegas, what’s up,” Justin, 27, asked the crowd as he donned a hot pink beanie and sunglasses in the early hours of Sunday, October 10. “This is the first show I’ve ever started at one in the morning.”</p><p>Music producer and DJ <strong>Marshmello</strong> also performed on Saturday night as Justin and Hailey, 24, left the club after the “Anyone” singer’s set.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“VEGA$$$,” the model captioned a series of photos from the weekend trip on Sunday.</p><p>Justin reacted with two heart eyes emojis while <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> gushed that Hailey looked “gorgeous” in the Instagram upload.</p><p>Music lovers can look forward to more <a href=#>Pollen Presents</a> events as the company builds exclusive multi-day travel and music experiences with <strong>J Balvin, Diplo, Brett Young, Ozuna, deadmau5</strong> and more as Pollen, a technology company building, curating and delivering incredible experiences for its members in over 30 destinations across the world, launches dozens of experiences globally in 2021 for over 200,000 travelers.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnq5mZsm621KyroqZdl7amrsSrZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BMoqVmpJGoerexxpqqZpufo7CmvtOsZKGnpJq5cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-cancel-guitar-center-order.html><span>←</span><span>How to cancel guitar center order</span></a>
