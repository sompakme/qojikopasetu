He has also cashed hefty paychecks for his work, roughly making $10 million per movie. One of his biggest paydays occurred with <i>Jurassic Park</i> when he made $250 million through backend profits in 1993. Through a deal with Universal, he makes $30 million per year, and Comcast purchased his movies for a $1 billion deal. <a href=#>His net worth stands at an astonishing $8 billion</a>, making him the second-richest celebrity after George Lucas.</p><p>The billionaire has a sprawling net worth that he spends on buying expensive motor yachts and real estate properties. After living in Coldwater Canyon for many years with his family, he moved base to Pacific Palisades with his first big purchase. Let’s look at his real estate portfolio worth $200 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-pacific-palisades-property>The Pacific Palisades Property</h2><p>It was 1985, and Steven Spielberg found the perfect home when he discovered a stucco mansion on a three-acre property in Pacific Palisades. One of the reasons why the director purchased the house was that many celebrities he admired had lived in the home, including Douglas Fairbanks, Cary Grant, Barbara Hutton, and Bobby Vinton. He hired architect Harry Newman to design a Spanish-style house with narrow windows. Featuring five bedrooms and six bathrooms, the property also has a Hobbit-inspired room for family gatherings.</p><p>As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, Spielberg expanded his compound in 2013 by installing a vineyard facing the Santa Monica mountains and the scenic Pacific ocean. The estate also has a freestanding bungalow that the director uses as a screening room and his study. The decor has wicker pieces, and the artworks feature family memorabilia and photos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-georgica-pond-compound>The Georgica Pond Compound</h2><p><a href=#>Steven Spielberg added another property</a> to the list when he purchased an East Hampton home in 2008 for $20 million and knocked down the property. He bought the estate under his company County Wexford Limited Liability, a name inspired by the Irish countryside where he filmed one of his famous movies Saving Private Ryan. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, the construction on the 3-acre waterfront lot was shelved for the longest time.</p><p>The property was constructed in the 1990s-era with traditional construction. It is located around the corner from the Atlantic Ocean beaches, a waterfront lot, making it one of the best properties on the East Coast. The estate is situated next door to Janet Ross, the widow of Arthur Ross. In 2014, Spielberg had listed the land for $24.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-cedar-shingled-guesthouse-quelle-barn>The Cedar-Shingled Guesthouse ‘Quelle Barn’</h2><p>In another property in the Hamptons, Steven Spielberg built a stunning guesthouse for his family and friends for overnight stays. <a href=#>He hired architect Charles Gwathmey</a> and interior designer Naomi Leff to design a cedar-shingled structure. The modern hotel has warm interiors and a unique structure that creates a comfortable space. Inside, it features muted colors for the art and furniture to match the pyramidical timber ceiling, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>.</p><p>The open kitchen has stone countertops, mahogany cabinetry, and a horse-head mold. The dining area is located across the terrace and faces the backyard, giving a view of their home dubbed Quelle Barn. Spielberg’s favorite part of the home is the skylit gallery, a passage to reach every bedroom. It displays artworks from the young visitors at the guesthouse. The children’s bedroom has a ship’s-style cabin with bunk beds.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-san-remo-building>The San Remo Building</h2><p>One of the most expensive apartment co-ops globally, the San Remo Building, was the first twin-towered residential space in New York City. It is located two streets away from the iconic Dakota building and has twenty-seven floors. The residential skyscraper on the Upper Side of Manhattan offers breathtaking views of Central Park. San Remo took two years to finish construction in 1931, and both buildings were sold for $25,000 in 1940.</p><p>Each unit features lofty ceiling heights, extensive galleries, and stunning details costing $5,400 per square foot. The twin towers are within walking distance from the Met, Central Park, Juilliard School, the Lincoln Center, and the American Museum of Natural History. Spielberg owns two units facing Central Park on the seventeenth floor. Other famous neighbors include Diane Keaton, Dustin Hoffman, and Bono.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-malibu-compound>The Malibu Compound</h2><p><a href=#>Steven Spielberg</a> acquired two properties on his Malibu compound in separate transactions in 1989 and 2000 for $6.575 million. Located 144 feet away from Broad Beach, his Malibu Home is a shingle-sided residence with an open floor living space. It features seven bedrooms, eight-and-a-half bathrooms, and a guesthouse with two bedrooms, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>. The central living space is designed with hardwood floors and has a media room, an open kitchen with a dining area, and a home theater with top-of-the-line projection equipment.</p><p>The second floor has the vast Master Suite with a private library, while the adjoining room has a massage room, a bathroom with a claw-footed bathtub, and a terrace that stretches the width of the residence. Spielberg sold the home in an off-market deal to Steve Gozini for $26 million, who put the house on sale for $35 million a year later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Steven Spielberg is also known to have homes in Naples, Florida, and a Long Island family home. <a href=#>The director also invested in a house on the water when he purchased a megayacht</a> called The Seven Seas worth $150 million, which has nine staterooms for eighteen passengers at once.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Pieces Of Jewelry Inside Meghan Markle's Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectural Digest</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrzEnqJmoZ6otqWxjKyrnq6Vo3q0vMieo5udopzAbn6PaWSmoZyhtrC6jKucmqRdmsC1rdOeZKmnoqmzsLjIqGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./7-actors-who-earned-the-most-and-8-who-earned-the-least.html><span>←</span><span>7 Actors Who Earned The Most (And 8 Who Earned The Least)</span></a>
