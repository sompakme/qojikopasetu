Thank you for the past decade of support, we have loved our staff, our patrons and our time together.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Speculation <a href=#>of trouble at the WeHo hotspot first sparked</a> in March when Us&nbsp;obtained a report from the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) that confirmed Pump had its general eating license and its event permits suspended.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Although the documents did not cite <a href=#>why the restaurant was under suspension</a>, an eyewitness exclusively told&nbsp;Us at the time that the business was not open the weekend of March 11, with a sign posted that read “closed due to rain issues.”</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Vanderpump, 62, later clarified the reasoning behind the temporary shutdown, citing the upcoming lease expiration as the core issue.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“We’ve been in the Pump location for 10 years, have a great relationship with the landlord, but the lease is expiring. So, over the next few months we will decide whether we are going to stay, but haven’t made a decision yet,” the<a href=#> Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> alum told Us exclusively&nbsp;</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>in a March 15 statement. “Come by and have a Pumptini.”</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The England native later took to social media to shut down any rumors of Pump closing for good. “Ok no … #PumpRestaurant will be open as normal … #fake-news,” she tweeted.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The reality star and her husband, <a href=#><strong>Ken Todd</strong></a> — who tied the knot in 1982 and share daughter Pandora and son Max, 31 — are the owners of several restaurants including TomTom and SUR. The pair’s Bravo series, Vanderpump Rules — which debuted in 2013 — focuses on the lives of the staff of the Los Angeles-based establishments.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The&nbsp;Pump Rules&nbsp;cast recently made headlines&nbsp;in March when news broke that <a href=#><strong>Ariana Madix</strong></a> called it quits with <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong> </a>after discovering his affair with costar <a href=#><strong>Raquel Leviss</strong></a>. The scandal sparked outrage from fellow cast members and viewers alike, leading Sandoval, 40, and <a href=#><strong>Tom Schwartz’s</strong></a> newest restaurant, Schwartz & Sandy’s, to receive an onslaught of negative Yelp reviews and hateful social media comments.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The backlash to their business caused Vanderpump — who co-owns TomTom with Sandoval and Schwartz, 40 — to issue a plea to viewers, <a href=#>asking them not to take out their frustrations</a> on the businesses.</span><span class=x_ContentPasted0>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“It’s a show but [the cast is] all hurting. And I am not saying we should let them off the hook. Condemn their actions but don’t condemn the people,” she said during an appearance on&nbsp;Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;With Andy Cohen&nbsp;on March 8. “All this [online] aggression has serious ramifications. I really mean that — I think everyone should be careful.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqWho5Z6t63NnZyrqKWivbR5z66kqWWimsC1rdSrmKesXZi5sL%2FIp55mnKWaerW7jKucp6xdnrukvsSaqp5n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./julius-erving-net-worth-how-much-is-erving-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Julius Erving Net Worth How Much is Erving Worth?</span></a>
