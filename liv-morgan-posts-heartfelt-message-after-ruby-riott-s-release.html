It’s a safe bet that she will return to her former name after her 90-day no-compete with WWE expires.</p><p>It’s worth noting that <a href=#>Aleister Black</a>, who was among the releases this morning, has already changed his name back to Tommy End on his Twitter account, so Ruby Riott might not be too far behind. As of this writing, Riott has yet to comment on her WWE release.</p><p>Ruby Riott signed with WWE back in December of 2016. She had a good run on the black and gold brand of NXT before being called up to the WWE main roster alongside Liv Morgan and Sarah Logan as the Riott Squad for the SmackDown brand. This immediately drew comparisons to Paige’s Absolution group on WWE RAW that formed just days before.</p><p>Although coming close a few times during her five-year run, Ruby Riott never captured any championships during her time with WWE.</p><p>There is no doubt that Ruby Riott will be heavily coveted from multiple national promotions when her 90-day deal is up. Between AEW, IMPACT Wrestling, and Ring of Honor, you can rest assured that Riott will land on her feet quickly.</p><p>What are your thoughts on Ruby Riott’s WWE release?
