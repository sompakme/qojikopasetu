As a result, at this point, it seems all but certain that Stallone will ultimately go down in history as a titan of the entertainment industry.For a very small group of people, however, Sylvester Stallone will always be known as one thing, dad. A father of five, Sylvester became a dad for the first time in the ‘70s and since then he helped to raise his two sons and three daughters.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Close Was Sylvester Stallone To His Son Sage?</a></span>Given that everyone has come to know Sylvester as a massively muscled action movie star, it makes sense that he reportedly had strong connections with his sons. Tragically, however, <a href=#>Sylvester’s ex-wife predicted that one of his sons would pass away</a> and she turned out to be right when Sage lost his life in 2012.Based on everything that is known about Sylvester Stallone as a father, it seems very safe to assume that he continues to have a touching relationship with his surviving son. Still, based on a story that Sophia Stallone shared, Sylvester has a truly adorable relationship with his daughters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=an-adorable-story-about-sylvester-stallone-rsquo-s-relationship-with-his-daughters>An Adorable Story About Sylvester Stallone’s Relationship With His Daughters</h2><p>In the year 2021, two of Sylvester Stallone’s daughters, Sistine and Sophia, launched a podcast called Unwaxed.

On the other hand, the Stallone daughters also aren’t shy about talking about their relationships with their dad.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During one episode of the Unwaxed podcast that was especially telling about Sylvester Stallone’s relationship with his daughters, Sophia Stallone told a revealing story. According to Sophia’s story, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sylvester gives his daughters dating advice</a> that reveals how much he wants them to value themselves.</p><p>"I was telling my mom about how I have a date this week, and my dad suddenly comes out of nowhere. He was dropping me some golden nuggets. He was like, ‘can I butt in here?’”</p><p>“He was saying about being patient for the right one and that the way that the guy treats you early on really is an indicator of how his overall personality will be in the relationship."</p><p>"He said it might be next week, or it might be when you're 35 years old, but choose happiness and true compatibility than chasing the clock."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Sophia Stallone revealed the advice her father Sylvester Stallone gave her, Sistine Stallone chimed in to praise their father’s perspective on dating. "Sometimes he is Shakespearian when it comes to dating."</p><p>In all reality, the advice that Sylvester Stallone gave his daughter Sophia Stallone was far from groundbreaking. Despite that, his remarks reveal how much Sly adores all of his daughters and wants to make sure they don’t rush into anything.</p><p>It also has to be said that the fact that Slyvester popped up out of nowhere with his pearls of wisdom is adorable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-facts-about-sylvester-stallone-rsquo-s-relationship-with-his-daughters>Other Facts About Sylvester Stallone’s Relationship With His Daughters</h2><p>On top of Sophia Stallone’s aforementioned story about what kind of father Sylvester Stallone is, the action star’s daughters have revealed several other anecdotes about their dad. Some of those stories unsurprisingly reveal that Sylvester Stallone is always there for his daughters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Sylvester Stallone's Daughter, Sophia Rose</a></span></p><p>In the past, Sylvester Stallone’s daughters have revealed that their grandfather was a hairdresser. Since Sylvester learned a few tricks from his own father, it turns out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he would dye his daughter’s hair</a> when they were growing up.</p><p>Even though Sylvester Stallone has given his daughters great dating advice, it turns out that he can also be a big pain when it comes to their love lives. In fact, Stallone is so protective of his daughters that he can be so intimidating to their potential love interests that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has been nicknamed the “Grim Reaper”</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Sylvester Stallone’s daughter have been open that when things go wrong in their love lives, it is their father they turn to. The reason for that is that, as Sistine Stallone revealed, is that Sylvester’s daughters would sometimes get him to break up with their boyfriends for them over text.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“He goes, ‘Let me tell you how a guy thinks’, and so he’ll write it to a text for us (sic): ‘Breaking up with a guy’. I think most of the time our boyfriends don’t know Sly is breaking up with them! It’s very quick, simple.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqsqSmmsC1sdFmqq2ZnKG8r7GMnZiun5ipsrO%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip2amn6x8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./swagg-huncho-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Swagg Huncho Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
