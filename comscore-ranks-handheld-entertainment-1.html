<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>ComScore Ranks HandHeld Entertainment #1</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>I last <a href=#>talked about HandHeld Entertainment</a> when they announced that they were acquiring <strong><span style=color:#c00>eBaumsWorld.com for $17.5 million</span></strong>. I also went into great detail on all the other site acquisitions they had over the past year and how their plummeting stock was a disaster!</p><p>In addition to keeping an eye on this stock and knowing pretty much all of the sites they have scooped up, I’ve also been holding stock in this company for a long time now. I first purchased right after they picked up <strong>Dorks.com</strong> back in <strong>November 2006</strong>… and have been buying on the dips, all the way down to <strong><span style=color:#c00>$1.50</span></strong>! (52wk Range: 1.00 – 7.78)</p><p>Today I was looking over my portfolio and saw my numbers were up pretty high. I noticed <span style=color:teal><strong>ZVUE</strong></span> (HandHeld Entertainment’s Stock Symbol) was up over <span style=color:#093>+50%</span>! For the first time, comScore is now measuring all of HandHeld’s Web sites as a single entity. This is a big change over and mainly because of HandHeld’s formal launch of ZVUE Networks, its online video advertising network. With the new ranking in place, HHE was ranked #1, at the top of the <span class=t2>‘<strong><span style=color:#06f>Top 10 Gaining Properties by Percentage Change in Unique Visitors</span></strong>” for August 2007. </span>HandHeld had the largest increase in unique visitors (U.S.) by <strong><span style=color:#f90>327%</span></strong> month-over-month from July 2007 to August 2007.</p><p>In addition to the big spike on news today, ZVUE also made news saying they will buy back over a million shares of their own stock over the next 6 months. With all the news on this stock and a company buyback in place, is it now time to buy into ZVUE? Time will tell, and I’m sure they will have more business acquisitions on the way.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiykZi3sLTNrKanZpOkunCvzqaqnKeimnqzrc2kqmagkaOxqbHLnWSepqSav7WtyKeknqakYn5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./barbie-ferreira-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Barbie Ferreira Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
