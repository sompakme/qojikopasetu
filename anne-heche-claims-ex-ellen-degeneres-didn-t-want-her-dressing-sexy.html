It’s because Ellen didn’t want me to dress sexy,” Heche said in the video, giving the ensemble a zero out of 10 and a big thumbs down. (Us Weekly reached out to DeGeneres for comment.)</p><p>The exes dated for three years before calling it quits in 2000. Throughout the course of their relationship, the pair were subject to <a href=#>widespread media attention</a> as it was uncommon at the time for two women to go public with a same-sex romance. Nearly two decades later, Heche reflected on how meaningful it was to have DeGeneres by her side.</p><p>“Our time was a beautiful part of my life and one that I wear with honor,” she told Mr. Warburton magazine in September 2020. “I was a part of a revolution that created social change, and I could not have done that without falling in love with her.”</p><p>The I Know What You Did Last Summer star added, “I’m proud to have been part of a revolution that helped move equality forward, but there is still work to do.”</p><p>While competing on season 29 of <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, Heche admitted that her past with the Finding Dory star “changed [her] life forever” — but it wasn’t all positive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Anne-Heche-Ellen-DeGeneres-Didnt-Want-Me-Dress-Sexy-Red-Carpet-0001.jpg><p>“I was in a relationship with Ellen DeGeneres for three and a half years and the stigma attached to that relationship was so bad that I was fired from my multi-million dollar picture deal and I did not work in a studio picture for 10 years,” the actress said while rehearsing with partner <a href=#><strong>Keo Motsepe</strong></a> in an October 2020 episode, noting that <a href=#>the comedian had warned her</a> about the backlash they might face.</p><p>Following her split from DeGeneres, Heche went on to tie the knot with <a href=#><strong>James Tupper</strong></a> in 2007. The pair split in 2018. The Carol Burnett Award winner, for her part, <a href=#>married <strong>Portia de Rossi</strong> i</a>n August 2008.</p><p>“She’s very, very funny. She makes me laugh, which is really important,” DeGeneres gushed about the Arrested Development alum, 48, during an appearance on <a href=#><strong>David Letterman</strong></a>‘s My Next Guest Needs No Introduction in 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Though the pair have been solid for more than a decade, de Rossi previously told Us&nbsp;that there was one surprising thing that made them finally feel like they’d found their place in the world.</p><p>“<a href=#>The divorce rumors came</a> and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,” she exclusively revealed in June 2018. “I’m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, ‘Oh, now we’re finally accepted.’ We get the same s–t as every celebrity couple.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6aeqmxwqGcZpuclrauv4yer2adnKGyr3nDnp6eppWnsrR5w6Kbp6xdrK6vwIyhnKtllKeytL%2FIp55mq5WtxnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-isabel-preysler-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Isabel Preysler?
