They found that the misconduct had been undergoing from the last quarter of 2015 to 2018.</p><p>"Kraft and its former executives are charged with engaging in improper expense-management practices," <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement</a> from the SEC read, "that spanned many years and involved numerous misleading transactions, millions in bogus cost savings, and a pervasive breakdown in accounting controls."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The SEC found plenty of faulty contracts that showed discounts that were secretly tied to planning <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">price hikes</a> and upfront payments that failed to disclose future orders.</p><p>Two former execs from Kraft Heinz received individual charges. Eduardo Pelleissone, former chief operating officer, and Klaus Hofmann, former chief procurement officer, agreed on paying a civil penalty of $400,000, according to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>. Because of this incident, Hofmann is paid $100,000 and is currently unable to serve within an officer or director position for the next five years. Pelleissone agreed to pay a $314,211 fine.</p><p>The SEC alleged that the two execs acted obliviously to the warning signs regarding the mishandling of Kraft Heinz's accounting.</p><p>Though Kraft put out <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a statement regarding the charges</a>, they carefully made sure not to confirm nor deny the legitimacy of the scheme.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We have fully cooperated with the SEC throughout its investigation," the conglomerate's global chief communications officer Kathy Krenger said in an email statement to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN Business</a> "and took prompt and extensive remedial action and proactive steps to improve our internal policies, procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting."</p><p>Krenger also expressed in a <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">separate statement</a> that the pitfalls which brought Kraft Heinz the eight-figure charge have since been taken attended to.</p><p>"The internal control weaknesses we identified and disclosed in 2019 were fully remediated in 2020. Kraft Heinz is much stronger today because of the actions we took and embedded into our company culture," Krenger explains.</p><p>The <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">conglomerate's stocks</a> dropped 1.53% the day the SEC's announcement was released.
