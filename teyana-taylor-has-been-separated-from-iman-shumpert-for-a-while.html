Not too much on my bestie!,” the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harlem native</a>, 32, began in defense of her children’s father. “In all fairness, Iman and I are separated and have been for a while. To be 1000% clear, ‘infidelity’ ain’t one of the reasons for our departure.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fashion Week staple </a>went on, “We are still the best of friends, great business partners and are one hell of a team when it comes to co-parenting our 2 beautiful children. Most importantly we are FAMILY & in the 10yrs together, 7yrs married we ain’t ever played with or about THAT. We just keep y’all asses out the group chat lol, which is the reason we’ve been able to successfully & peacefully separate without all of the outside noise.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Taylor went on to explain why she chose to address their relationship status with the public, deeming it “unfair” for false “narratives” to ruin anyone’s reputation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The only reason I’m even sharing THIS part of the chat is because the narratives are getting a little out of hand & it’s unfair to all parties involved. I hope this provided some clarity for y’all. Okay AunTey taking y’all back out the chat bye!”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Closer To God”&nbsp;singer took to Instagram to set the record straight following a week of social media rumors surrounding NBA pro Shumpert potentially stepping out on Teyana with an artist of his. The whispers became so prominent that Kelly Price felt the need to speak up for Taylor after a blogger disparaged her marriage.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Teyana is not a side piece, she’s not a side h*e, she’s a wife,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Price, 50, began</a>. “I went through it, but this is not about me. I listened to this blogger go off on Teyana. I’m actually emotional, I was venting to my husband because I get so angry when I see this kind of thing. We always talk about Black needing to support Black, Black needing to do this. I just listened to a female Black woman who is a blogger go in on Teyana Taylor, basically calling her all kinds of things. You know, the fact that she speaks up for her family. When there are allegations out there, that she comes to the defense of her family and… her husband. What else is she supposed to do? She’s a wife, they have a family, they have a home, they own businesses together.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If anything is worth fighting for, it is your family, and especially if it can be saved,” Price continued. “I just don’t understand why wives get attacked so bad and side b***hes get praised.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">News of the Shumperts’ <a href=# id=auto-tag_separation data-tag=separation>separation</a> comes two days after reports of Jeezy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">filing for divorce</a> from TV host Jeannie Mai.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6myuq3NmmStmamhvLN50p6nmqqRqbKlecWrpqZlmaKur3nSoaymqJWnwW6yzqtkmmWnnbatsYxqaWxsZ25%2Bc4SUaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mark-webber-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Mark Webber Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
