Actors and music stars are often seen flaunting their hot rides around town, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to pimp out their rides. It is not unusual for celebrities to spend six figures on their car or to have multiple cars. Aston Martins, Lamborghinis, and Rolls Royces are among the norm for these wealthy Hollywood folks. However, there are some celebrities that feel they have nothing to prove to anyone and do not mind riding around in a clunker of a car. You would be surprised by some of the rich and wealthy stars that are driving cheap cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cars that these 15 celebrities drive are definitely cheap by celebrity standards. These industry professionals have millions and millions of dollars and could afford any car they wanted, so why choose an average car? Some celebrities drive less expensive, environmentally-friendly cars, some drive old cars that they feel nostalgic about, some like being anonymous in an average-looking car, and some are just frugal and do not want to spend a lot of money. Regardless, they have all spent less than $50,000 on their cars, which is mere chump change for these well-to-do, affluent people.</p><p>Whether these celebrities would rather spend all of their millions on humungous houses or lavish jewelry or just do not want to have a flashy, shiny car, these 15 celebrities are extremely loaded but still drive absolutely garbage cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio>Leonardo DiCaprio</h2><p><a href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a> is one of the most well-known actors in the world, starring in blockbuster&nbsp;hits like The Departed, Titanic,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Wolf of Wall Street. This Hollywood star's estimated net worth is over $245 million. However, he does not spend his millions on his cars. Leo drives an environmentally-friendly Toyota Prius.</p><p>DiCaprio is known for being an environmental advocate, which may have been his motivation behind purchasing this four-cylinder electric car. He has been a Prius owner since the car was first introduced in 1997, which was also the year his breakout movie&nbsp;Titanic&nbsp;came out. A Toyota Prius goes for between $19,600 and $29,900 which seems to have been relatively easy on the millionaire's wallet. Leo does not hide the fact that he owns a cheap car and may have sacrificed speed and luxury for his Prius. He&nbsp;is regularly spotted driving around town by the paparazzi.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hanks>Tom Hanks</h2><p><a href=#>Tom Hanks </a>is a successful actor and producer who probably does not need any introduction. Hanks has starred in classic films like Forrest Gump, The Da Vinci Code, Saving Private Ryan, and Cast Away. He has been working in the film industry for the last thirty years or so and has definitely raked in a decent amount of cash. He has an estimated net worth of around $350 million but that does not stop Tom from driving around in his Scion xB.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with a Scion xB, but it is not exactly the luxurious car that you would expect one of the world’s biggest movie stars to be driving. The car costs a mere $15,000. The actor has apparently modified the engine of the car to be electric. The cost of that is reportedly somewhere around $55,000 but that is chump change for a multi-millionaire like himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence>Jennifer Lawrence</h2><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence </a>is one of the highest paid female actresses in Hollywood. She has played the lead role in wildly successful films like the Hunger Games franchise films and box office hits like X-Men and Silver Linings Playbook. She makes millions of dollars a year and seems to be on quite a roll but she does not spend her fortune on a car to drive around in.</p><p>She did not go for an exotic, fancy, high-powered vehicle. Instead, Jennifer chooses to get around town in her Volkswagen Eos, which only cost her around $35,000. The VW has a reasonable 2.0L turbocharged 200hp engine. Lawrence could afford a car worth ten times what her little VW cost her. Her estimated net worth in 2017 was a whopping $130 million.</p><h2 id=pope-francis>Pope Francis</h2><p>The Pope is not necessarily a celebrity but he is one of the most well-known men in the world. When people think about the Pope in a car, they probably think about the Popemobile. The Popemobile is a modified SUV that has bulletproof glass so that the Pope can ride freely around in the crowds and be seen. However, the Popemobile is not what the Pope actually drives in his spare time. Did you know that the Pope drives around by himself?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Pope has a personal vehicle which he has been spotted driving around in from time to time. Pope Francis is known for his humility and casual persona, so it should come as no surprise that he drives around in a 1984 Renault 4 hatchback. The car had actually been donated to him to drive around the grounds of the Vatican in. The car costs a couple of thousand dollars at most to be purchased used.</p><h2 id=daniel-radcliffe>Daniel Radcliffe</h2><p><a href=#>Daniel Radcliffe </a>is pretty much only known for being in the Harry Potter films. He has done a few movies since then and most famously did a stint in Equus on Broadway where he went on stage fully exposed. He has made a ton of money off of the Harry Potter franchise and it would be safe to say he could afford an extremely expensive car. His estimated net worth is over $100 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the actor did not choose a fancy vehicle and instead went with a Fiat Punto, which cost him around $17,000. The actor apparently wanted to have a car that was environmentally conscious and did not contribute to pollution too much. The Fiat Punto is a pretty tiny car, with the largest engine available engine being a 1.9L diesel or 1.8L gas with just 178 hp.</p><h2 id=jay-leno>Jay Leno</h2><p><a href=#>Jay Leno</a> is on millions of television screens every night on The Tonight Show. The late-night talk show host has an estimated net worth of over $350 million. Jay Leno has one of the largest car collections in the world, with over 250 automobiles that have an estimated worth of over $50 million. He owns super unique cars like a 1909 Baker electric car and a McLaren MP4-12 supercar. However, this does not mean that Leno did not let a few garbage clunkers slide into his ridiculously diverse car collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jay still owns a 1991 GMC Syclone that is tucked away in his multi-car garage. There were less than 3,000 GMC Syclone cars to ever be produced. The pickup truck looks like any other standard GMC except it has a turbocharged 4.3 LV6 that produces 280 hp for the AWD system. It costs around $26,000 for a new truck.</p><h2 id=zac-efron>Zac Efron</h2><p><a href=#>Zac Efron</a> got his start in acting with his breakout role in the Disney Channel hit movie, High School Musical. Since then, he has gone on to star in big movies like 17 Again, The Lucky One, Neighbors, and Baywatch. Efron has an estimated net worth of around $18 million and could definitely afford to be driving around a nicer car than he was for a while.</p><p>The Hollywood star was known for driving a 1999 Oldsmobile Alero around Hollywood. The model of car was only produced between 1998 and 2004 and the Alero was actually the last car produced by the Oldsmobile brand. The actor eventually gave his car to a charity organization who auctioned it off. He upgraded and got himself and Audi A8.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=conan-o-brien>Conan O'Brien</h2><p><a href=#>Conan O’Brien</a> got his start in the entertainment industry writing for Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons. He has had a successful career in comedy and then went on to do work on Late Night and The Tonight Show before landing his own series, Conan. Despite all of the money he has made working over the years, Conan cannot bear to part ways with his old 1992 Ford Taurus SHO.</p><p>Conan’s Taurus has a 3.0L V6 engine, which produces 220 hp, which is not impressive by today’s standards but two decades ago, it would have been more than enough. It only cost him around $24,000 back when he bought it. Nowadays, you can find a used Taurus to buy for only a couple thousand dollars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-timberlake>Justin Timberlake</h2><p><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> started off his wildly successful music career as the lead singer of the boy band, N’SYNC. Today, he is topping the charts with hit song after hit song. He is also married to Hollywood actress <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a>. Timberlake does not need to be frugal with his money in any sense but he still drives around in his fourth-generation Volkswagen Jetta. The car only costs around $16,000 and is an extremely practical choice for the pop star with a net worth of around $230 million.</p><p>Maybe the “Can’t Stop The Feeling” singer likes to have an average-looking car so that he can run to the store when he needs to without being hounded by the paparazzi. Whatever the reason, you will not catch J.T. riding around town in a fancy Ferrari.</p><h2 id=john-goodman>John Goodman</h2><p>You may remember <a href=#>John Goodman </a>from the classic show, Roseanne, or maybe you recognize him from recent flicks like Kong Skull Island: Monarch Files 2.0 or Atomic Blonde. John Goodman may have starred in television series and big-time movies but he still enforces his average guy-persona by driving around in his 1997 Ford F-150. He has proven that he does not care for fancy cars and would prefer his pickup truck any day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Goodman has had an Emmy and Golden Globe-winning career but his laid-back ride seems to suit his nonchalant personality well. With a net worth of over $60 million, Goodman could afford to drive any kind of car he wanted but he loves his old car and as long as it is still running, he will still be driving it.</p><h2 id=mel-gibson>Mel Gibson</h2><p><a href=#>Mel Gibson </a>is an actor and filmmaker known for his hits like Mad Max, Lethal Weapon, and Braveheart. He has all the fame and fortune he could ever want but he has never gone off and gotten a fancy car. Gibson has been snapped in photos by the paparazzi driving around Hollywood in his sixth generation Toyota Cressida. A used Cressida only costs a couple hundred for a worn and torn version, and it's over $10,000 for a pristine version. However, this is still nothing compared to Mel’s $425 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although, Mel did lose $425 million to his ex-wife of 31 years during their divorce settlement, so maybe he is on a budget. The actor’s Cressida has a 190 hp 3.0L V6. The car may not be flashy or glamorous but this may have been a benefit for him when he was trying to hide from the media during his years of scandal.</p><h2 id=lily-allen>Lily Allen</h2><p><a href=#>Lilly Allen</a> may be a hit-making songwriter who wrote tracks like “Smile” and “Not Fair” but she is not too fancy for her Ford Focus. The singer drives around in her lime green Focus, which only cost her around $16,000. The car may have also been a gift from Ford as a ploy for the singer to promote the car. In this case, the car would have been free. There is nothing cheaper than free. Either way, Allen could definitely afford a nicer car with an estimated net worth of $20 million.</p><p>This pop star certainly does not look like one when she is off duty and driving around in her average-looking car. You probably would not even recognize her if you saw her driving around town.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=colin-farrell>Colin Farrell</h2><p><a href=#>Colin Farrell</a> is an Irish-American actor had his breakthrough role in the 1998 film, The War Zone, and has starred in hit flicks like Total Recall, The Beguiled, Horrible Bosses, and Pride and Glory. Farrell’s had a long acting career and has an estimated net worth of over $30 million. Despite his financial comfortability, Farrell still likes to keep things cheap and simple, especially when it comes to the car he drives.</p><p>Colin drives a fifth generation Ford Bronco from the mid-nineties. The SUV is known for its strong build and quality V6 and V8 engines but it is hardly the top of the line when it comes to SUVs. Regardless, Farrell loves driving his old clunker and has not traded it in for a newer model. Older Broncos in good condition will actually go for around $40,000, which is still not much for the multimillionaire.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clint-eastwood>Clint Eastwood</h2><p><a href=#>Clint Eastwood</a> is a legend in the acting world and has directed and produced his own films as well. You would probably recognize him from Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino, Dirty Harry, and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Eastwood has an estimated net worth of over $375 million. You could say he is pretty well off but this Hollywood big shot does not look like he is worth hundreds of millions of dollars when he is driving around on the streets.</p><p>Clint drives a GMC Typhoon, a limited-edition SUV series built in 1992 until 1993. The car looks similar to GM’s popular Jimmy SUV series. Eastwood’s Typhoon has a turbocharged 4.3L V6 engine that produces 280 hp for the AWD system. It also has a 0-60 time of only 5.3 seconds.&nbsp;However, the car is only worth $20,000 to $30,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-begley-jr>Ed Begley Jr.</h2><p><a href=#>Ed Begley Jr.</a> is not necessarily a name that you will remember but he probably has a face that you would recognize. Begley has had roles in major movies like Ghostbusters, Pineapple Express, and popular shows like Better Call Saul, Portlandia, Monk, and 7th Heaven. Although he may not be as rich as some of the other celebrities on this list, Begley is definitely still well off. He had&nbsp;an estimated net worth of $5 million as of 2013, but he still drives around in a Toyota RAV4.</p><p>The car only costs around $24,000 but it is an environmentally friendly car. However, the actor could definitely do better for himself in the car department if he wanted to. There are a wide variety of economically sound cars on the market today but Ed still chose to go for one of the most average cars around.</p><p>Sources: motor1.com,&nbsp;worldfactsftw.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2hvKKwxJ1knJ2cmq%2B0edOhmK1llKe2t7GMoJirmpGcsm6vwKuqaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-bob-iger-s-net-worth-after-his-return-to-disney-as-ceo.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Bob Igers Net Worth After His Return To Disney As CEO?</span></a>
