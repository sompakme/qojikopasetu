Although many people have argued Rock’s joke was in poor taste, there are still plenty of people willing to dish out serious cash to seem him perform live, as his recent ticket sales prove.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As per <a href=#>Entrepreneur</a>, the comedian has since a dramatic increase in ticket sales for his show Chris Rock Live since the incident took place. Ticketing company TickPick shared on Twitter that more tickets were sold in the last 48 hours than the previous month combined.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rob Kardashian & Tyga Deny Blac Chyna's Claims They Don't Support Their Kids</a></span></p><p>Rock kicked off the comedy tour with <a href=#>two shows in Boston</a> on March 30th, both of which were completely sold out In addition, his upcoming show scheduled in Boston for April 1st is completely sold out. Some tickets are even popping up on retail sites for nearly $5,000 a piece.</p><p>Although certain shows still have tickets available, as of publication, Rock has sold-out shows coming up Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, California, and Maryland.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Now that we are 48 hours from Sunday evening, it’s evident that demand for Chris Rock shows has jumped dramatically, based on our ticket buying trends on StubHub,” StubHub representative, Mike Silveira, told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a> .</p><p>“At this stage in his tour, on an average day, we’d expect to see a spike in sales in the 24 or 48 hours prior to a show date as last-minute sales roll in – but it is incredibly unusual to see the spike we have experienced,” he continued.</p><p>After staying silent for nearly a week, Rock first addressed Will Smith’s punch at his Boston show, though he said it was only to address the elephant in the room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't have a bunch of s*** about what happened, so if you came to hear that, I had like a whole show I wrote before this weekend,” the comedian told the crowd, as per <a href=#>CNN</a>. “And I'm still kind of processing what happened, so at some point I'll talk about that s***. And it'll be serious and it'll be funny, but right now I'm going to tell some jokes."</p><p>Smith – who took home the Oscar for Best Actor for his role in King Richard – has issued an apology for his behaviour. "I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be,” he wrote via Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Smith added that while he found the joke about his wife’s condition “too much for me to bear,” he believes “violence in all forms is poisonous.”</p><p>The Academy has also released a statement condemning Smith’s actions and violence in general. It’s also been revealed Smith was asked to leave the ceremony, though he declined and later went on stage to accept his award.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>$2.5 Million in Luxury Cars Recovered After Fraudulent Purchases</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Entrepreneur</a>, <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, <a href=#>CNN</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqb7IrGSrp5OgerW1wqScratdp7a0sYysnKWkXaTCtXnSoaawq12Ws7Wx0WauoqScYsCutdOhZKirk5a%2Fbr%2FLmqdo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chris-long-nfl-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Chris Long (NFL) Net Worth</span></a>
