We all get on the train of dance music. We need to all respectfully look through the carriages that have come before us and realize how we got here.”</p><p>-“My whole thing with EDM is, if you have integrity and yet you regress in how you’ve been as an artist, there’s something not quite right there. If you’re just here to get paid, I find that very culturally indifferent. When you go into the studio, you have to know what you’re going in there for. I went into the studio because I had a voice and I wanted to change things, and I don’t necessarily mean my bank account. The money is almost a B factor, a side product.”</p><p>-‘This Is A Bad’ is about driving through an estate and I’ve got my shotgun loaded and I’m thinking ‘I’m gonna do this guy’, probably going through what my son’s gone through.”</p><p>-“A very famous critic called Joseph Rykwert, in 1972, said about graffiti, “the barbarians from within will take over,” and that’s what happened with this music. We were punk-esque. I came from punk. So we were the bastard child of rave, and dubstep is the legitimate child of drum’n’bass, whether you like it or not. Young people are coming out, and it’s important to understand that they’re having their time. It’s their little scene, but that scene’s come from ours.”</p><p>– “I look back on all of this music as my own Instagram, my waypoint. I always remember exactly what I was doing, where I was, and what the record meant to me.”</p><p>-“It’s not everyone’s cup of tea. If you don’t want to listen to it, jog on. Don’t care. Go and listen to something else – because there’s something else for young kids, maybe.”</p><p>– “We need to think about the younger generation. I made my first record at 27, and there are people who are 17 and 18 out there making records. Technology is acceptable and accessible now, and there’s a whole generation of people who are turned onto this music. What are we going to do, just turn a blind eye to them? We still need to try and educate them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8sXnQrqatnaNisbPBzGalZpqRqMBuvMiopZ6domK0sLjDopxmaWNufXqCjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sheryl-lynn-piland-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Sheryl Lynn Piland Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
