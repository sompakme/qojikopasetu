Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey each get their turn to experience love and heartache through a series of flings and relationships, some more memorable than others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While every couple on the show has their funny moments, it’s clear that some fit together beautifully. Others are more painful to watch thanks to their awkwardness and cringe-factor. Being hard-core fans of the show, we decided to rank the relationships that appear on the show from those that work to those that don’t work.</p><p>Keep reading to find out our ranking of the relationships of the main cast of Friends, ranked from the couples who were a little stupid to those who are clearly soulmates.</p><h2 id=joey-and-rachel-are-kind-of-stupid><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Joey And Rachel Are Kind Of Stupid</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/joey-adn-rachel.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a>&nbsp;fans will agree that the silliest relationship on the show was Rachel and Joey, who get together briefly in the final season. Of course, there are a few fans who liked these two together, but for most people, it just feels wrong to see these two friends be romantic together, especially given Rachel’s history with Ross.</p><h2 id=kathy-is-a-terrible-girlfriend-to-chandler><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Kathy Is A Terrible Girlfriend To Chandler</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/chandler-and-kathy.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chandler</a> can be sarcastic and cold but he’s still one of the most endearing characters on the show and we only want the best for him. That’s why it’s so hard for us to see him go through all the pain he endures during the Kathy saga. Ultimately, Chandler means very little to Kathy, which is heartbreaking for him and for us.</p><h2 id=we-can-t-approve-of-rachel-and-mark-because-it-leads-to-the-break><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>We Can’t Approve Of Rachel And Mark Because It Leads To The Break</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Rachel-And-Mark.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Mark might have some positive qualities as a character, we just can’t condone the inkling of a relationship between him and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rachel</a>. Although Ross is unreasonably jealous of Mark, his presence is still one of the factors that result&nbsp;in Ross and Rachel going on a break. And we all know how that ends up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Fan Theories About Rachel Green Make Too Much Sense To Ignore</a></span></p><h2 id=charlie-and-joey-are-totally-mismatched><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Charlie And Joey Are Totally Mismatched</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/joey-and-charlie.jpg><p>Charlie has a lot of impressive qualities, but she is the worst possible partner for Joey. Even though these two might be physically attracted to each other at first, they don’t have a single thing in common and are never once on the same page. Charlie also isn’t a great partner for Ross, dumping him as soon as her ex wants her back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ross-and-carol-have-an-unhappy-marriage><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Ross And Carol Have An Unhappy Marriage</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/friends-Ross-And-Carol.jpg><p>Carol is actually one of our favorite Friends characters because she is a good friend to Ross, even after their marriage doesn’t work out, she’s a loving mother, and she’s a fully fleshed out LGBT character. But in terms of their romantic relationship, Ross and Carol are the worst. Neither has what it takes to make the other happy.</p><h2 id=chandler-and-janice-could-never-be-happy><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Chandler And Janice Could Never Be Happy</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chandler-And-Janice-.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oh my god! In later seasons, it’s totally clear that Janice is the wrong girl for Chandler since her character becomes a joke rather than someone to be taken seriously. But there is a time when Chandler genuinely thinks of Janice as a real love interest and we can’t understand why.</p><h2 id=ross-and-emily-aren-t-meant-to-be><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ross And Emily Aren't Meant To Be</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ross-and-emily.jpg><p>To be fair to Emily, it would be devastating to have your fiancé utter someone else’s name in front of everyone you know at your wedding. But it doesn’t matter at the end of the day, because these two just aren’t right for each other and never had the potential to last.</p><h2 id=richard-is-charming-but-can-t-give-monica-what-she-wants><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Richard Is Charming But Can't Give Monica What She Wants</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monica-and-richard.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many Friends fans are smitten with Richard, while others find him totally creepy. We think that, at the end of the day, Richard is the wrong guy for Monica because he can never give her what she wants most: a family. Although these two are attracted to each other, they just want different things and are therefore incompatible.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">We've Ranked The Friends Characters In Order Of Who We'd Want To Be</a></span></p><h2 id=janine-nearly-turns-joey-into-a-jerk><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Janine Nearly Turns Joey Into A Jerk</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/janine-and-joey.jpg><p>Together, Janine and Joey are certainly a very good-looking couple. But, attractiveness doesn’t automatically result in a happily ever after. Because Janine doesn’t like the other friends, she brings out the worst in Joey, nearly convincing him to blow them off and making him lie about her whereabouts. Sorry, Janine. These guys are a packaged deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ross-and-julie-s-relationship-isn-t-fair-on-julie><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Ross And Julie’s Relationship Isn’t Fair On Julie</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ross-And-Julie.jpg><p>We shudder when we think of Ross and Julie’s relationship, and that’s not a reflection of Julie at all. Instead, it’s a reflection of how terrible Rachel is towards Julie when she dates Ross, and how she doesn’t deserve any of the mean things that Rachel does to her. Poor Julie!</p><h2 id=if-it-weren-t-for-minsk-david-would-have-ended-up-with-phoebe><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>If It Weren’t For Minsk, David Would Have Ended Up With Phoebe</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/phoebe-and-david.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let’s be honest: if David were never called to work in Minsk, he probably would have lived happily ever after with Phoebe.

Throughout the show’s run, these two make a lot of mistakes and hurt each other in a lot of ways. Neither one of them is perfect, and their relationship is a little toxic. But it’s clear that despite it all, they’re still lobsters who are meant to be.</p><h2 id=mike-accepts-phoebe-for-who-she-is><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mike Accepts Phoebe For Who She Is</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mike-and-phoebe.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike doesn’t appear until the later seasons of Friends, but he’s still one of our favorite characters. He is superior to all of Phoebe’s other love interests, including David, because of the way he accepts her for who she is and encourages her to be herself. At the same time, he doesn’t let her walk all over him. They strike the perfect balance together!</p><h2 id=monica-and-chandler-are-soulmates><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Monica And Chandler Are Soulmates</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/monica-and-chandler.jpg><p>It should come as no surprise that the best relationship on Friends, in our opinion, is the one shared by Monica and Chandler. These two begin as friends, have a fling, fall in love, and realize that they want to spend the rest of their lives together.
