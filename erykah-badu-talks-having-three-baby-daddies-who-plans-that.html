But, when those things start to happen, you don’t stop living.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=#>“Hello” creator </a>also points out that sometimes relationships don’t last due to incompatibility between partners, resulting in lovers moving on to form unions with other people. “Not everybody knows how to be mate,” she laments, but says it’s not due to a lack of effort. “We try, you know but we’re not taught that. That’s something we don’t know how to do. It’s a whole culture built around it, but we don’t even know how to do it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1428798619.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Baduizm creator also points to matters of the heart sometimes overpowering ones judgement in the short term, thus resulting in longterm effects, such as parenthood. “Let’s be transparent, for my sisters out there,” Badu told the show’s cohosts. “We fall in love, you know, love is a chemical thing. We fall in love. Really I think God make us fall in love just long enough to get pregnant so that we can go ahead and procreate.” Badu explains.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The singer also shared her thoughts about marriage, arguing that it’s been promoted as a cultural construct, but isn’t a prerequisite for happiness and isn’t an experience she desires. “It doesn’t fit everybody,” the Dallas native said of being a bride. “It doesn’t fit me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Badu has three children by three different men, all of whom happen to be musical artists themselves. Her eldest child, Seven, was fathered by <a href=# id=auto-tag_andre-3000 data-tag=andre-3000>Andre 3000</a>, whom she dated during the mid-late ’90s.&nbsp;Her middle child, <a href=#>Puma Curry</a>, is the daughter of rap legend <a href=# id=auto-tag_the-d-o-c data-tag=the-d-o-c>The D.O.C.</a> and was born in 2004. In 2009, she gave birth to her youngest child, Mars Merkaba Thedford, the daughter of rapper <a href=# id=auto-tag_jay-electronica data-tag=jay-electronica>Jay Electronica</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Erykah Badu’s interview with The Breakfast Club below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5q%2FurfAoWSbmZSqerW00Z6cZpqRl8ZusMCdm6Kdo2Kvs7HApJ2aq6RisK3BwWZoa2tkbIB4fZhyZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cory-gunz-net-worth-how-much-is-cory-gunz-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Cory Gunz Net Worth How Much is Cory Gunz Worth?</span></a>
