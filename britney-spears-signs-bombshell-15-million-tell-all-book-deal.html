The&nbsp;insider told the outlet that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">“the deal is one of the biggest of all time,"</a> only being surpassed by the Obama's.</p><p>Britney has been planning on writing a book ever since her sister, Jamie Lynn Spears, penned her scathing tell-all, Things I Should Have Said. Jamie Lynn used the book to make a series of shocking allegations against her sister. In one chapter, Jamie Lynn claimed that her older sister locked the two of them in a room while holding a knife because she was inexplicably “scared.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Donald Trump Quietly Pockets A Fortune As His Coffee Table Book Grosses $20 Million</a></span></p><p>“I’ve never been around you ever with a knife or even would I ever even think to do such…only a scum person would make up such things about someone,” Britney responded. “Hope your book does well, Jamie Lynn.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The book didn’t sit well with Britney, who repeatedly slammed her sister for making up lies <a href=#>to sell a “Hollywood book”</a> at her expense. Jamie Lynn fired back at her sister on Instagram, writing, “I hate to burst my sister’s bubble, but my book is not about her.”</p><p>For what it's worth, Jamie Lynn claimed that money wasn’t a motivating factor for her she says she penned the book to address her past, deal with it, and move on.</p><p>In January, Britney <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hinted that she would pen a book of her own</a>&nbsp;to set the record straight. The Womanizer singer shared a picture of a typewriter in January with the caption: “Shall I start from THE BEGINNING???”</p><p>The $15 million Britney is allegedly getting to pen the tell-all is the same amount President Bill Clinton got for his post-presidency memoir&nbsp;My Life&nbsp;in 2001. Neither comes close to the $60 million the Obama’s got for the rights to their story in 2017,&nbsp;which is the largest ever known figure for a nonfiction book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Britney Spears Claims More Than $36 Million Taken From Her During Conservatorship</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PageSix</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSvs7XTp5yyZaOlsqK%2B0maqop%2BeqHqju8ybqqGdnKF6tbHLpWSapJxifnZ5waimpGWUmq6tew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./boxer-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Boxer Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
