Four days later, Storm celebrated her title win with an official acceptance speech on AEW Dynamite.</p><p>For this special occasion, Storm was introduced by RJ City and Renee Paquette. Recent AEW signee Mariah May then presented Storm with the AEW Women’s Championship. In her subsequent acceptance speech, Storm issued her thanks to AEW President Tony Khan, Warner Bros. Discovery, the women’s locker room, and the fans, especially “The Little Toni Storms” who look up to her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Before Storm could exit the stage, though, she was interrupted by Skye Blue, who was headed down to the ring for her match against Anna Jay and Ruby Soho. Storm, of course, did not appreciate the interruption. Now, the two will go one-on-one on Wednesday’s episode of AEW Dynamite. There, Storm will defend the AEW Women’s Championship against Blue.</p><p>Before their clash on Dynamite, Storm and Blue delivered messages to each other on Saturday’s episode of AEW Collision. As Storm mocked Blue’s new “spooky” appearance, Blue responded with a line out of Storm’s playbook. “I’m gonna have my chin up, my t*ts out, and I’m gonna shove my shoe right up your ass,” Blue said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=#>AEW Women’s Title Match, Continental Classic Matches Set For 12/6 AEW Dynamite</a></p><h2>DREAMWAVE’S ‘Uprising’</h2><p>This Friday, <a href=#>DREAMWAVE Wrestling</a> will host its first-ever all-women’s show, Uprising.

Now, Brooks prepares for her first title defense.</p><p>At DREAMWAVE’s Uprising event, Brooks will put her title on the line against “The Russian Dynamite” Masha Slamovich.
