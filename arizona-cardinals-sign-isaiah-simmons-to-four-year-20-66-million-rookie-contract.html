The Clemson product is renowned for his remarkable athleticism and versatility, having also played cornerback, safety and defensive end.</p><p>Although the Cardinals could use Simmons in many different ways, the belief is that they'll keep him in one position. Still, it's nice for head coach Kliff Kingbury and defensive coordinator Vance Joseph to have all these options with Simmons.</p><p>Simmons was instrumental in leading Clemson to a national championship in 2018. Aside from earning&nbsp;unanimous All-American honors in 2019, Simmons was also named the ACC Defensive Player of the Year, and he also took home the Butkus Award - given annually to the top linebacker.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Thomas & George Kittle Top "Madden 21" Wide Receiver, Tight End Ratings</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With Simmons now signed, only four of the top 12 draft selections have yet to sign their rookie deals: Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, Washington defensive end Chase Young, New York Giants offensive tackle Andrew Thomas and Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert.</p><p>Last season, the Cardinals finished 28th in scoring defense and last in yards allowed. But with Simmons now in the fold, Kingsbury and Joseph can expect major improvement on that side of the ball. Simmons will work alongside star pass rusher Chandler Jones and perennial Pro Bowler and cornerback Patrick Peterson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Cardinals are widely expected to compete for a playoff berth following the additions of both Simmons and superstar wideout Deandre Hopkins, who was acquired via trade with the Houston Texans. Even if they're not a playoff team in 2020, the Cardinals certainly won't be boring to watch with all this talent on both sides of the ball.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>The Boys Season 2 Teaser Shows Off Stormfront, The Seven's Newest Hero</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom5Gnsaq6wKWqZquZnLtutdKaoJqgXai2rrnOp6pmrJ9iv7C7yqKcZpufo8GzrcKtZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./andy-griffith-show-reenergizes-real-life-mayberry-in-north-carolina-wsoc-tv.html><span>←</span><span>Andy Griffith Show reenergizes real-life Mayberry in North Carolina WSOC TV</span></a>
