Whether it is <a href=#>makeup trends</a>, funny phrases, or the <a href=#>incredible breakout cast</a>, many aspects of the show have blown up since. Two of its leading ladies, in particular, Sydney Sweeney and Maude Apatow, have seen great levels of praise and fame following their performances as on-screen sisters Lexi and Cassie Howard. Whilst Apatow may have <a href=#>come from a line of talented industry giants</a>, her co-star <a href=#>Sweeney’s start in the industry</a> was far more complicated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think 'Euphoria' Stars Maude Apatow And Lukas Gage Are Dating</a></span></p><p>However, despite their differences in background, the pair seem to have developed a special and unique friendship during their time on the show. Whilst, yes, all the cast members seem to have <a href=#>developed unique friendships</a> with each other, the bond shared between the young actresses is definitely a standout. So let’s take a detailed look into Sweeney and Apatow's close friendship and how it came to be as strong as it is.</p><h2 id=this-is-the-adorable-way-that-maude-apatow-and-sydney-sweeney-met><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>This Is The Adorable Way That Maude Apatow And Sydney Sweeney Met</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the first season of Euphoria was released back in 2019, Sweeney and Apatow have been joined at the hip. It seems as though this friendship was near-instantaneous upon their first meeting according to the Euphoria stars. During an exclusive interview with People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney and Apatow went on a deep dive through their friendship </a>and even detailed their adorable first meeting.</p><p>Apatow stated, “I remember meeting Sydney, and we were like eating lunch in a church, and we met that one day,” Before then adding, “And you asked to sit with me, and I was like ‘She’s so nice’”. Sweeney then added to this stating that the reasoning for her approaching Apatow before anyone else was because she had “looked like the sweetest one to go up to.”</p><h2 id=their-on-screen-sister-relationship-seems-to-translate-off-screen><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Their On-Screen Sister Relationship Seems To Translate Off-Screen</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As previously mentioned the pair of young stars portray sisters Lexi and Cassie Howard on the show. During the interview, the pair both highlighted how this sisterly relationship was not only felt on-screen but also off-screen after the cameras stopped rolling. After a plethora of compliments about how it was like working with each other, Sweeney heartwarmingly stated that Apatow truly was “the sister she never had.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Are Fans Upset About Sydney Sweeney And Jonathan Davino's 13-Year Age Gap?</a></span></p><h2 id=however-this-is-how-their-relationship-differs-from-their-lsquo-euphoria-rsquo-characters><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>However, This Is How Their Relationship Differs From Their ‘Euphoria’ Characters</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2><span class=item-num>6 </span><span></span></h2><p>However, despite their sisterly relationship, the pair were eager to highlight the differences between their characters and the relationships they shared between them. In Euphoria, Sweeney’s Cassie and Apatow’s Lexi have a more tense and complicated relationship as both sisters struggle to understand each other due to their fundamentally different characteristics. However, this barrier does not seem to be there for the actresses themselves and the relationship they share.</p><p>Whilst speaking about this Apatow stated, “I feel like Cassie and Lexi have some real like underlying tension and issues,” before later stating that Sweeney and herself certainly didn’t have that between them.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-maude-apatow-and-sydney-sweeney-39-s-friendship-developed><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>This Is How Maude Apatow And Sydney Sweeney's Friendship Developed</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout the 4 years of working side by side, Sweeney and Apatow have built a strong and stable friendship along with a unique bond. It is easy to see how this bond has come around as they mentioned how much time they had to spend together and what that meant for their friendship.</p><p>Apatow highlighted the easygoing nature of their friendship as she stated, “I don’t know if I even put like any expectation of what you were going to be like.” Sweeney then added how she had felt that there had not been any surprises and that they had both been “really open to each other and their friendship” which meant that they could sit back and let their bond grow and blossom.</p><h2 id=this-is-why-maude-apatow-and-sydney-sweeney-39-s-friendship-is-so-special><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>This Is Why Maude Apatow And Sydney Sweeney's Friendship Is So Special</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, as easy as the friendship may have come, it was certainly something special and unique. Sweeney highlighted this as she explained the complications that often came with forming such close bonds in their industry and how the pair’s friendship had not really encountered any of those issues.</p><p>The actress stated, “It’s so hard, not just being girls it's hard to have friendships. And then also in our industry because we’re constantly traveling, we’re constantly moving from one project to another, and you don’t have that much time to really nurture a friendship.” Later adding, “Being able to have Euphoria, we do spend so much time together and then build it through. It's been like 4 years now.”</p><h2 id=maude-apatow-and-sydney-sweeney-rely-on-each-other-a-lot-during-filming><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Maude Apatow And Sydney Sweeney Rely On Each Other A Lot During Filming</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout those 4 years on the show, the pair have not only provided a heartwarming and wholesome friendship to each other but have also provided moral and professional support to the other. During the People interview, they highlighted how they would often go to each other when they needed help with their performance or whenever they felt like something hadn’t gone quite right during the shoot.</p><p>Apatow highlighted this as she stated, “Having a stressful day and knowing we have each other afterward, or if anything goes wrong we can just talk to each other afterward which is really nice.” Sweeney agreed before adding, “Also I feel so much better knowing that I can just call you and be like ‘Maude is this normal?’”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Did Maude Apatow Become Famous (And Wind Up On 'Euphoria')?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-rsquo-re-each-other-rsquo-s-ldquo-ride-or-die-rdquo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They’re Each Other’s “Ride Or Die”</span></h2><p>Whilst it's clear to many that the pair truly are BFFs it seems as though they like to go by another, far more serious label. Back in April 2022, Sweeney herself posted an adorable <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">picture of herself and Apatow </a>on her Instagram which she captioned “my ride or die.” The picture showed Apatow and Sweeney side by side with huge smiles as they posed for the camera. Apatow herself even commented under the picture saying “I love you” to her bestie.</p><h2 id=and-they-rsquo-re-not-afraid-of-showing-it><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And They’re Not Afraid Of Showing It</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The adorable “ride or die” pic that Sweeney posted was not the first time that the pair flaunted their friendship on their socials. In fact, both Sweeney and Apatow frequently post cute friendship pics of each other on their Instagram and Twitter. Whether it is<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> adorable BTS pics</a>, glitzy red carpet and photoshoot looks, or simply just casual snaps of them hanging out, the pair aren’t shy to show their world who their best friend is.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Did Machine Gun Kelly Want Sydney Sweeney To Be His Girlfriend?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmq2UmnqivMCtprBlo66xr7HYZqqwnZWjsrp5xK6noaeinq5urcOoqZqanJp6sLLFrJqrnZWjeqe%2ByJ6lnauYnr1w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./manlikeisaac-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Manlikeisaac Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
