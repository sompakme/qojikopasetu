Adam met her during his high school days at Glynn Academy.</p><p>Wainwright plays as a pitcher for the&nbsp;St. Louis Cardinals. The star baseball player is known by nicknames ‘Uncle Charlie’ and ‘Waino.’</p><p>Seventeen years after his debut in Major League Baseball, Waino is still making headlines for his match-winning performances.&nbsp;</p><p>Uncle Charlie is scheduled to play against his former teammate Fernando Tatis Jr. on August 29 when the Cardinals take on the Padres.&nbsp;</p><p>Adam has won over 190 games with an impressive 60% win-loss ratio. On top of that, he has also received three All-Star selections and two Gold Glove Awards in his illustrious MLB career.</p><p>Regular baseball followers genuinely know his credentials and admire him for the quality player he is.</p><p>Apart from the playing career, it is evident that people want to know more about their favorite players, including their family life. And it is no different for Uncle Charlie either.</p><h2 id=who-is-adam-wainwright-wife><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-wainwright-married-his-high-school-sweetheart></span> Adam Wainwright Married His High School Sweetheart<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Wainwright is married to his high school sweetheart Jenny Curry from Georgia. Curry holds a degree in interior design from Georgia Southern University.&nbsp;</p><p>A year after she graduated from college, the pair decided to bind their relationship into marriage.</p><p>There is an exciting story about the MLB star proposing to Curry. Amid Adam’s proposal, a telephone call regarding his move from Atlanta Braves to Cardinals interrupted him. Fair enough to say he got double happiness that day.&nbsp;</p><p>Waino may be a superstar on the field, but he strongly considers his better half as the real star. Uncle Charlie credits Jenny for caring for everything and maintaining a strong family bond.&nbsp;</p><p>The adorable couple is still going strong together, 19 years after their nuptials. &nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=wainwright-walking-with-waino-movement></span>Wainwright Walking with Waino Movement<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although Wainwright used to go to church since their childhood, it was after marriage that their religious faith in Christianity grew further. Jenny helped him find his belief and relationship with religion.</p><p>In an interview, Jenny Wainwright mentioned how Adam had committed his life to Jesus Christ. She further expressed her delight at how her husband has grown up as the family’s spiritual leader.</p><p>Adam is widely known around the MLB arena as an outspoken Christian. Wainwright led more than 22,000 people through the Bible in 2020 via his Twitter account, “Walking With Waino.”</p><p>The famous baseball player considers this holy act to be one of his most significant accomplishments in life.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=proud-father-adam-wainwright><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-wainwright-children></span> Adam Wainwright Children<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Wainwright children are four daughters and a son named Baylie Grace Wainwright, Morgan Addison Wainwright, Macy Wainwright and Sadee Faith Wainwright.</p><p>The record-breaking MLB pitcher praises his life partner for gracefully taking on the massive responsibility of raising them all.</p><p>Life as a baseball spouse is not as easy as people make it look from the outside. Adam travels across the country for his MLB games and other club commitments. Taking care of five children alone is not easy at all.</p><p>In a recent interview, Jenny talked about how she raised them. The most difficult would be when the children fall sick while Adam is on the road.</p><p>Jenny has done everything to ensure that their kids have a memorable childhood. She has taken care of everything on her own in the absence of her husband.&nbsp;</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-wainwright-daughters></span>Adam Wainwright Daughters<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The star baseball pitcher became a father for the first time on September 6, 2006. Mrs. Waino&nbsp;gave birth to a cute baby girl whom they named <strong>Baylie Grace</strong>. Adam shares a strong bond and charming relationship with his firstborn child.&nbsp;</p><p>Wainwright became a father for the second time a couple of years later. Adam and Jenny were blessed with <strong>Morgan Addison</strong> in 2008.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Macy Wainwright</strong> was born as the third daughter of the Waino couple in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Wainwright, an incredibly proud and overjoyed father, shared the news of his fourth child through his Twitter handle on December 28, 2015. His fans and well-wishers expressed their delight and sent tons of congratulatory messages.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=adam-adopted-a-son></span>Adam Adopted a Son<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Adam shared the news of adopting a baby boy as his fifth child via Twitter on April 25, 2019. He was filled with joy and emotions while introducing the new member to the family.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lots of cool things happening lately but nothing compares to this. @Mrswaino and I have been waiting anxiously to announce that we have added a beautiful little boy to our family. So, I’d like to be the first to introduce Caleb Adam Wainwright to all of you! Praise the Lord! pic.twitter.com/akILgy6sEl</p><p>— Adam Wainwright (@UncleCharlie50) April 25, 2019</p><p>Wainwright’s son is named <strong>Caleb Adam Wainwright</strong>.&nbsp;Moreover, he does not want to use the term ‘adopted’ and instead refers to himself as unique to the family.&nbsp;</p><p>The kind-hearted couple hopes their adoption story encourages others to adopt as well. Wainwright believes that many beautiful little children require parents.</p><h2 id=wainwright-parents><span class=ez-toc-section id=wainwright-parents-separated-when-he-was-seven></span> Wainwright Parents Separated When He Was Seven<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam Wainwright parents are <strong>Bill Wainwright</strong> and <strong>Nancy Wainwright</strong>. Bill is a professional attorney, whereas Nancy is a real estate agent.&nbsp;</p><p>Waino’s parents divorced when he was only seven years old. His father, Bill, moved to Florida leaving Nancy alone to raise the children.</p><p>Adam has an elder brother named Trey Wainwright who is 7 years older than him. Trey is an attorney in Atlanta now.&nbsp;</p><p>MLB superstar credits his brother for teaching him everything about baseball after their father left. Trey built a pitcher’s mound in their backyard to teach his younger brother how to pitch. And no wonder, Waino is a highly successful baseball pitcher now.</p><p>Despite his father leaving him early, Nancy and Trey ensured that the little one had a bright future. He remains extremely thankful to his mother and brother for all their hard work, sacrifice and efforts.</p><h2 id=wainwright-loves-his-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=wainwright-is-a-family-man></span> Wainwright is a Family Man<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Adam describes himself as a proud husband and father. He loves his beautiful family more than anything else.</p><p>Despite being fully fit and vaccinated, Waino briefly left the Cardinals squad on late April 2021. He took leave to take care of his family members, all of whom have caught the Corona Virus.&nbsp;</p><p>Adam also tweets photos and videos of himself spending quality time with his family. He often says that his favorite time is being with the family amidst the season-long pressure of high-octane baseball matches.&nbsp;</p><p>With a long career and a proud legacy behind him, Uncle Charlie is contemplating retirement. He understands what it’s like to grow up without your father at home, having experienced it himself. Waino does not wish the same for his children as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Last September, Adam shared a video where he asked his family members whether to play for another season or not. All the children along with Jenny said to continue playing.&nbsp;</p><p>And here he is, still bossing his pitcher role for the Cardinals at 41 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmUlrpuw8CipbCqmZy1tXnWop2eZZqau6%2FFjJysq6qpYryvedGaoKyhnpx6p7XVnmScoJmhsbOxzWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-method-actors-who-scared-their-co-stars-on-set.html><span>←</span><span>15 Method Actors Who Scared Their Co-Stars On Set</span></a>
