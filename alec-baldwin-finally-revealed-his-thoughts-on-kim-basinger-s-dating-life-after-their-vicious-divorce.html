This includes things he has said on The <a href=#><strong>Howard Stern </strong></a>Show. Of course, <a href=#>the most successful radio host </a>of all time was once known for his shocking and outrageous sense of humor. His radio show, which is now on SiriusXM, inspired every star to really push the envelope. And that's precisely what Baldwin did every time he appeared.</p><p>But it was during his 2003 interview that he pulled back the curtain on <strong>his relationship with his ex-wife, Kim Basinger</strong>.

While the Batman star has largely been out of the public eye, aside from <a href=#>losing a chunk of her net worth buying a town</a>, Basinger spent years being scrutinized by the press. And this was mostly during her highly-public and extremely contentious divorce from Alec Baldwin. This is something Baldwin has blamed on their divorce lawyers.</p><p>Since then, Baldwin and Basinger have basically said nothing about one another to the press. This seemed to have been for the benefit of <strong>their daughter, Ireland Baldwin</strong>. Therefore, we know little about what each other thinks about what happened to their love lives. But in 2003, Baldwin shed light on his divorce from Basinger. On top of this, he admitted how he actually felt about seeing her move on with her life...</p><ul><li><strong>Following Baldwin and Basinger's divorce, the two waged an ugly custody battle over Ireland</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/alec-baldwin-and-kim-basinger-wedding.jpg><p>During <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alec Baldwin's 2003 appearance on The Howard Stern Show</a>, the Departed star was asked about his dating life. Given that Baldwin was newly single after <strong>almost ten years of marriage</strong>, Stern was fascinated with his exploits. But even after Baldwin started to explain what he'd been up to, Stern turned the conversation to his ex-wife, Kim Basinger.</p><p>"I'd still bang Kim.

While Baldwin tried to talk around the gruesome details while speaking to Howard Stern in 2003, Basinger revealed a bit more. Although her comments were on The Red Table Talk with Jada Pinkett-Smith in 2022. During this, she said the following:</p><p>"[We] went through a heavy-duty, very out loud when you're in the public, divorce."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/alec-baldwin-and-kim-basinger-young.jpg><p>Basinger then told Pinkett-Smith that she and Baldwin didn't see eye-to-eye when they were co-parenting their singular child. This internal struggle seemed to play into the now-infamous voicemail that Baldwin left for Ireland in which he called her an assortment of names. Baldwin later claimed he was very clearly taking his anger out on his daughter when it was meant for her mother.</p><p>"Obviously, as most people can deduce, I was really speaking to someone else on that voicemail."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kim-basinger-s-experience-with-mickey-rourke-in-9-1_2-weeks-was-a-complete-nightmare.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kim Basinger's Experience With Mickey Rourke In 9 1/2 Weeks Was A Complete Nightmare</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Making 9 1/2 Weeks was unpleasant for Kim Basinger, and Mickey Rourke didn't help her cause.</span><p>According to Time, he also accused Basinger of leaking the voicemail recording in order to smear his character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Alec Baldwin's Relationship History After Divorcing Kim Basinger</strong></p></td><td><p>According to People and Who's Dated Who</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alec Baldwin dated Kristin Davis</p></td><td><p>They dated briefly in 2001 during Baldwin's separation from Basinger</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alec Baldwin dated Nicole Seidel</p></td><td><p>They dated from 2002 to 2009</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alec Baldwin dated Anna Rothschild</p></td><td><p>They date for a short time in 2003</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alec Baldwin dated Lori Singer</p></td><td><p>They dated from 2006 until 2010</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alec Baldwin dated and married Hilaria Baldwin (born Hilary Hayward-Thomas)</p></td><td><p>They started dating in 2011, were engaged in 2012, married two months later, and have 7 children together</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>During her 2022 appearance on Red Table Talk, Kim Basinger claimed that she and Alec Baldwin had a hard time communicating during their marriage. This was a contributing factor in their divorce. She claimed that he came from a family that didn't value being in touch with one's feelings. Of course, this is just her perspective.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet, in the older years of Ireland Baldiwn's life, her mom and dad have been able to see eye-to-eye.
