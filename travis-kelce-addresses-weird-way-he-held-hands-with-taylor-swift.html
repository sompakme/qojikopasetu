Their friend Brandon started off by praising Travis’ approach.</p><p>“He’s a door opener, he’s a f—king hand-holder. He crushed it,” Brandon said. “So much footage breaking down Travis Kelce’s hand-holding.”</p><p>Jason, 35, meanwhile, made a joke <a href=#>about the photos of Travis and Swift’s outing over the weekend</a> in New York City. “He’s a created character in [Alexis Hall’s romance novel] Boyfriend Material,” the professional football player, who is married to Kylie Kelce, quipped.</p><p>Travis didn’t mind poking fun at photographers <a href=#>capturing him holding Swift’s hand in both of his</a>, adding, “Yeah, they caught me with some weird hand-holding poses there. That was crazy.”</p><p>The athlete’s romance with Swift, 33, <a href=#>has been on everyone’s minds since they took things public</a>. Travis and Swift were recently seen out and about twice in New York after making cameos for <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>‘s hosting debut on <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> on Saturday, October 14.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/travis-kelce-addresses-weird-way-he-held-hands-with-taylor-swift-inline-01.jpg><p>Before going public as a couple, Travis revealed <a href=#>he attempted to make a move on Swift</a> while attending her Eras tour concert.</p><p>“Well, I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” Travis told Jason on their podcast in July, noting that he put his phone number on a friendship bracelet. “She doesn’t meet anybody — or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal. But it was an unbelievable show. Kansas City showed out.”</p><p>Travis <a href=#>offered an update on his personal life</a> two months later, telling <a href=#><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></a> on her “Let’s Be Honest” podcast, “To really dive into a relationship with somebody … it’s going to take some time.”</p><p>He added: “You’ve really got to know somebody to take that step and really be committed and be in full throttle. I can’t just meet somebody and automatically think that forever is just a day away. It’s too much. I’m setting myself up for failure.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/travis-kelce-addresses-weird-way-he-held-hands-with-taylor-swift-inline-02.jpg><p>That same month, Swift responded to Travis’ <a href=#>attempt at shooting his shot by showing up to support</a> the Kansas City Chiefs when they played the Chicago Bears.</p><p>“Shout out to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy,” he gushed on his podcast days later. “I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her. The friends and family. She looked amazing … and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans. We script it all, ladies and gentleman. It was absolutely electric.”</p><p>A source has since told Us that <a href=#>the pair’s inner circle think they are a good fit.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Friends close to Taylor and Travis think they make an amazing power couple, and they couldn’t be happier for them,” the insider shared this month. “He makes her feel safe and protected, and at the same time, he supports her independence and success.”</p><p>According to the source, Travis “goes out of his way” to make Swift feel special. “Travis is different from anybody Taylor has dated before and she is falling for him more and more as the days go by,” the insider concluded.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatqpGrtrR5yp6jnJ1dlrGlvsSsqp6rXayyqr7DZq6asV2dsm60xKWbZqCRo7G0edaiq6FlpJbGrbvRZqqwoZapfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jarquez-hunter-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jarquez Hunter Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
