From then on, the characters would make animated appearances in shows like Scooby-Doo in the 1970s. It has also had several spinoffs, including Halloween with the New Addams Family in 1977 and The New Addams Family in 1998.</p><p>Vic Mizzy’s popular theme song for <strong>“The Addams Family</strong>” caught on with viewers and made monster stars out of its monstrous cast.</p><p>They’re creepy, and they’re kooky,</p><p>Mysterious and spooky,</p><p>They’re all together ooky,</p><p>The Addams Family.</p><p>Dying a quick death after only two seasons, the cast moved on with their careers, some with continued progress, and others, not so much, but none could ever leave their “<strong>Family</strong>” ties with the show.</p><p>Let’s discuss what the actors who lived life into the practically dead characters of Morticia, Gomez, Fester, Grandmama, Lurch, Pugsley, Wednesday are doing now.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Carolyn Jones – Morticia Addams</strong></h2><p>Academy Award-winning actress Carolyn Jones had a successful film career, working with Hitchcock to Elvis to Sinatra.&nbsp;</p><p>Morticia chose to be Mrs. Addams long black dress twice more in the ’70s, but she went on to add over 30 more roles to her profile after the show ended.&nbsp;</p><p>Memorable ones included Marsha, Queen of Diamonds for five episodes of “Batman,” playing Chuck Connors’ wife on “Roots,” and Queen Hippolyta on “Wonder Woman.” While fighting with colon cancer, she pressed on working in her final role — another powerful mother, Myrna Clegg, on the soap opera “Capitol.” She died of cancer in 1983, at age 50.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Astin — Gomez Addams</h2><p>An earlier concept of “<strong>The Addams Family</strong>” that was being brought to networks centered around the adventures of the butler, titled “<strong>Lurch</strong>,” with John Astin penciled in for the lead role.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/John-Astin-—-Gomez-Addams-683x1024.jpg><p>He refused the opportunity and finally signed on instead as the energetic and eccentric cigar-chomping Addams patriarch Gomez. Astin said “<strong>Gomez is really an extension of my own personality … the closest thing to who I am, really</strong>.”</p><p>He has never abandoned his “Family” far behind, going Gomez for a 1977 Halloween special, an early ’90s cartoon series, and then voicing Grandpapa in the animated “The New Addams Family.” A proud graduate of Johns Hopkins, he returned to the university to help build up their theater program.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jackie Coogan — Uncle Fester</h2><p>Jackie Coogan’s star burned bright in the 1920s, being named <strong>“the greatest boy actor in the world,</strong>” starring alongside Charles Chaplin in “<strong>The Kid,”</strong> and even having chocolate bars shaped like his head sold in stores.</p><p>Four decades later, “The Addams Family” allowed his star to shine again, playing the nutty, pale-skinned lightbulb lighting Uncle Fester. But earlier, after his first audition, Jackie was declined for the part of Uncle Fester.&nbsp;</p><p>However, he needed it so badly that he went home, shaved his head, did his Uncle Fester’s makeup and costuming, and returned. He nailed it and got the part, as we all know.</p><p>He died of a cardiac arrest in 1984 at age 69.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ted Cassidy — Lurch / Thing</h2><p>The character of Lurch is well recognized for his tall stature at 6 feet 9 and deep bass voice.

Aside from his role as Lurch on The Addams Family, he would also narrate<strong> </strong><strong>The Incredible Hulk</strong><strong> TV series</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Cassidy’s big break was The Addams’ Family Role. Or Roles. Because Ted’s hand portrayed Thing as well. Though the character of Lurch was intended to be mute when Cassidy ad-libbed “<strong>You rang?</strong>” The subtle humor and sultry deepness to his voice was instantly a hit, and the character was expanded.</p><p>His voice was his golden ticket, and he voiced many cartoons, including 1976’s Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle, Captain Caveman, and the Teen Angels.</p><p>&nbsp;If you remember Captain Caveman, you should check out along with 9 others in our Cheesiest Cartoons from the 70s list!&nbsp;</p><p>His height allowed him notable guest roles, like in 1976 when he portrayed Bigfoot in a two-parter for The Six Million Dollar Man! He sadly passed away in 1979 from complications following a non-malignant tumor removal from his heart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marie Blake – Grandmama</h2><p>Grandmama is none other than Marie Blake.

She passed away in 1978.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Lisa Loring – Wednesday Addams</h2><p>The now 61-year-old actress Lisa Loring performed the role of Wednesday Addams.

Christopher Hart would play the role of The Thing for feature films.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Felix Silla – Cousin Itt</h2><p>Cousin Itt is a hirsute made up of floor-length hair, almost as weird as The Thing! A bowler hat and sunglasses often accompany his appearance to give off the illusion that there is a face underneath all that hair.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Felix-Silla-–-Cousin-Itt-683x1024.jpg><p>Felix Silla would play the role of Cousin Itt for the 1964 series, followed by several other actors in the spinoffs.
