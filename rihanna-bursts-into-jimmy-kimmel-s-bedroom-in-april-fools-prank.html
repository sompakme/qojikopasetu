Jimmy Kimmel had the shock of his life in the early hours on April Fools’ Day (Wednesday, April 1) when Rihanna crept into his bedroom and woke him up with a psychedelic performance of “Bitch Better Have My Money!”
The 27-year-old singer was let into his home by Kimmel’s wife, Molly McNearney, and snuck upstairs to his bedroom, where the 47-year-old was sleeping.
Giving the show host a dramatic alarm call, the Barbadian beauty then launched into a hilarious performance of her new hit single, throwing real money across the bed as strobe lights flashed in time with a booming bass."><meta name=author content="Jenniffer Sheldon"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
