The woman in the video, Daisy, was laying down laughing while getting a foot massage in an erotic pose. This prompts Drake to try and log into his banking app to give her a $499 tip. However, the rapper’s transaction was promptly declined. “Embarrassing!” Drake says in response.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jill Duggar Cashes In On New Tell-All Book ‘Counting The Cost’</a></span></p><p>The viral video spurred a variety of reactions online. Many people found the moment hilarious and relatable. However, there was also speculation over why the transaction was declined, considering Drake is known for having a lot of wealth of his name.</p><p>The Canadian native is worth <a href=#>approximately $250 million dollars</a>. He’s not only made his fortune through his music career and investments, but also lucrative gambling streak.</p><p>The entertainer has won a number of huge bets, <a href=#>including a $1.7 million win earlier this year</a> after betting on Jon Jones at UFC 285.
