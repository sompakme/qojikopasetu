OK, maybe that's not entirely true, but endorsement deals never hurt and, for athletes preparing for life after sports, <a href=#>getting deals</a> like these can change lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For many of the best athletes in the world, endorsements are a fact of life but, for these few, it's everything. These are some of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest and best contracts</a> a sports star could hope for.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>8 Highest Paid Athletes Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=rory-mcilroy-taylormade>Rory McIlroy (TaylorMade)</h2><p>Rory McIlroy is another in a long line of athletes to partake in Nike's generous offerings. His listing here, however, isn't for that one.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Northern Irish golfer</a> signed on with TaylorMade back in 2017 for $34 Million. The deal, coupled with contracts alongside Omega and Upper Deck, have made him wealthy beyond the sport.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=steph-curry-under-armour>Steph Curry (Under Armour)</h2><p>They call Steph Curry "Mr. Warrior" and the Golden State Point Guard has earned that nickname. He sends fans scrambling to their feet and he sends brands scrambling for his endorsement. Under Armour is one of those brands.</p><p>Despite being one of the highest paid athletes in the world, his Warriors income is actually less than his endorsement income of $42 million&nbsp;with Under Armour, making it the fourth-highest endorsement deal of any athlete globally and making him one of the <a href=#>highest endorsed athletes of all time.</a></p><h2 id=tiger-woods-nike>Tiger Woods (Nike)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nike has endorsement money burning a hole in their deep pockets and, for a brand that says "Just Do It", few stars do it better than <a href=#>Tiger Woods</a>.</p><p>The famous golfer has had his ups and downs on the scandalous roller coaster, but even his most hardened critics can't take away from his amazing record on the green. Tiger has earned a tremendous amount from golf, but loyalty came with his endorsements.</p><p>Following his string of scandals in 2009, many different sponsors went running, but EA Sports and Nike stood their ground. They rallied behind the star and, through their sponsorships and his continued success on the holes, he saw his overall wealth balloon to over $1.5 Billion by 2018. Today, he has a net worth of $800 Million.</p><h2 id=lionel-messi-adidas>Lionel Messi (Adidas)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lionel Massi is an incredibly successful footballer (soccer player to the those in the States). He's one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">highest paid athletes in the world</a> and considered to be one of the greatest players to ever lace up a pair of cleats. So when Adidas came calling, they came in high. With an $80 Million offer, Messi was more than happy to become their smiling spokesman.</p><h2 id=cristiano-ronaldo-nike>Cristiano Ronaldo (Nike)</h2><p>To those familiar with international football, Cristiano Ronaldo needs no introduction. The legendary player is not only well known on the field, but also on social media. As of today, <a href=#>he has 275 million followers on Instagram</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He also happens to be on the highest paid athletes on Earth and, when it comes to sponsorships, he's kicking goals in that deparment as well.</p><p>Much like Michael Jordan and another name you will see listed soon, Ronaldo is part of the “Nike billion dollar club”. He signed a deal with the brand that lasts for life and could have the potential to reach $1 Billion over time.</p><p>Add to that his deals with&nbsp;Herbalife, EA Sports and Tag Heuer and you can understand why even his native country of&nbsp;Portugal honored him with an official airport renaming after he lead them to a UEFA Euro victory.</p><h2 id=lebron-james-nike>Lebron James (Nike)</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lebron James stands as one of the most inspirational and respected NBA stars in history. With a well-known reputation for giving back, Lebron has never been shy about helping others. When you add that to his storied career on the court and how, straight from high school, he was a number one draft pick, James is truly a star shining brightly.</p><p>Because of that, his endorsements are worth a lot to any brand lucky enough to get him on board. A short stint with Lebron as your company's face would be worth millions for anyone. That's not a guess either, at 18, he turned down a $10 Million offer from Reebok so he could talk with Nike.</p><p>Nike, took things a step further and, rather than a few years, they offered him a lifetime deal. So, how how much did that net him? Try a $1 Billion. By the time he hits 64, that number could easily be reached.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Forbes: Roger Federer Is The Highest-Paid Athlete Of 2020</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Man Of Many</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pledge Sports</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Sports</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1qrPHnqqtZaCWtqV5wK2fpZ2kmnqmusOoqaydnZq7tb%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./devin-ratray-biography-age-net-worth-actor-singer-and-songwriter-movies-tv-shows.html><span>←</span><span>Devin Ratray Biography, Age, Net worth, actor, singer, and songwriter, Movies, Tv Shows</span></a>
