She first appeared on American rapper Jermaine Dupri's reality television series The Rap Game in 2016, where she was known as Miss Mulatto and won the show's first season, but she rejected the record deal offered as a result of winning the show, Latto returned this week with her new banger “FTCU”—a.k.a. “Fuck the Club Up”—and its official video. The song features Southern rappers GloRilla and the legendary Gangsta Boo. Latto praised the latter MC during her recent interview with Nardwuar, questioning why the former Three 6 Mafia member is often overlooked.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED</b><a href=#><b>:</b></a><a href=#><b>Stacey Abrams Takes Over Latto Stage Show With ‘My Body, My Choice’ Sign In Atlanta</b></a></span></p><p>“Gangsta Boo is so Southern,” she said at the 8:50 mark. “I don’t know why the fuck they don’t give Gangsta Boo her props, you know she paved the way for a lot of Southern rap.”</p><p>“FTCU” arrives more than eight months after Latto unleashed her sophomore studio album 777. The project spanned 13 tracks, including singles like “Big Energy” and “Wheelie” featuring 21 Savage. 777 peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200 chart and boasted guest appearances by Lil Wayne, Childish Gambino, Lil Durk, and Kodak Black.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#><i>Complex</i></a>, Last month, GloRilla gifted fans with her debut EP Anyways, Life’s Great... The release delivered nine tracks, such as the Cardi B-assisted “Tomorrow 2,” “Get That Money” with Niki Pooh, and her hit record “F.N.F (Let’s Go).” Prior to that, Glo received some kind words from fellow Memphis native Gangsta Boo.</p><p>“I been watching them girls for the past couple of years and I was like, ‘What the fuck?’ It made me feel good, they represented Memphis right,” she told Drink Champs about the city’s women rappers. “It’s only been me and [La] Chat that came out of Memphis. A year later, GloRilla got signed. I got distracted because I was thinking of her glow-up. I think she was 19, remember when [I] was that age?”</p><p>In other news, GloRilla linked with Funk Flex on Friday to spit a freestyle.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>:</b></a><a href=#><b>Bob Dylan’s ‘Desolation Row’ Handwritten Lyrics Are Being Sold for $425,000</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Complex</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5osDTqGStmaCoeqi4zqugpaSRYq6vsIygmKefo6mubq7OqGSfp6Jiu6bDjKymp59dm8GkwY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-did-corey-gamble-and-kris-jenner-meet.html><span>←</span><span>How Did Corey Gamble And Kris Jenner Meet?</span></a>
