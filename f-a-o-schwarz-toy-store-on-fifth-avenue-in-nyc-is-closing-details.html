In 1992, it was featured in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, and was renamed Duncan’s Toy Chest. But its perhaps best known for being featured in <strong>Tom Hanks</strong>‘ 1988 smash <strong>Big</strong>, where his character Josh plays “Chopsticks” on a giant floor piano.</p><p>Fifth Avenue may become a little less crowded come July, but another F.A.O. Schwarz is set to open before 2016. Toys “R” Us, which now owns the iconic establishment, announced the news on Friday.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The company is committed to the F.A.O.
