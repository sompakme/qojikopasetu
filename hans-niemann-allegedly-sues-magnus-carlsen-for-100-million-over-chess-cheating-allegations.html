The complaint states that he is seeking "damages in an amount to be determined at trial, but no less than One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000)". The text of the complaint does not mince words, per <a href=#><i>Chessbase</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Checkmate: Chess Legend Nona Gaprindashvili Sues Netflix For $5 Million Over Remarks In Queen's Gambit</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was a step many speculated might happen. Hans Niemann has filed a complaint in the United States District Court, in the Eastern District of Missouri. The complaint cites Magnus Carlsen, the Play Magnus Group, Chess.com, LLC Daniel Rensch, and Hikaru Nakamura, seeking damages of no less than one hundred million dollars, with a jury trial demanded.</p><p>The full 44-page complaint can be read here.</p><p>Quoting very lightly the complaint, the text does not mince words:</p><p>Carlsen, having solidified his position as the “King of Chess,” believes that when it comes to chess, he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.</p><p>(...)</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><li>Notorious for his inability to cope with defeat, Carlsen snapped. Enraged that the young Niemann, fully 12 years his junior, dared to disrespect the “King of Chess,” and fearful that the young prodigy would further blemish his multi-million dollar brand by beating him again, Carlsen viciously and maliciously retaliated against Niemann by falsely accusing Niemann, without any evidence, of somehow cheating during their in-person game and demanding that the organizers of the Sinquefield Cup immediately disqualify Niemann from the tournament.</li><li>When tournament officials refused to comply with Carlsen’s corrupt and cowardly demand to baselessly eliminate Niemann from competition, Carlsen lashed out again, this time by boycotting the remainder of the Sinquefield Cup in protest—an unprecedented act for a top chess professional, let alone the reigning World Champion.</li><p>Needless to say, the Twitterverse is already exploding. USA Today Sports reporter Tom Shad already commented:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Niemann, 19, has admitted to cheating on two occasions, once when he was 12 years old and a second time when he was 16. But he denied claims that he cheated in an over-the-board match against Magnus Carlsen this year, per <a href=#><i>CNBC</i></a>.</p><p>Carlsen withdrew from the Sinquefield Cup in September after losing to Niemann, and eventually came forward with concerns that Niemann had cheated in the match in which he defeated Carlsen.</p><p>“When Niemann was invited last minute to the 2022 Sinquefield Cup, I strongly considered withdrawing prior to the event. I ultimately chose to play,” Carlsen, 31, said in a statement posted to Twitter in late September. “I had the impression that he wasn’t tense or even fully concentrating on the game in critical positions, while outplaying me as black in a way I think only a handful of players can do.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The suit claims that Carlsen’s comments were a retaliatory attempt to keep Niemann from damaging his reputation.</p><p>“Enraged that the young Niemann, fully 12 years his junior, dared to disrespect the ‘King of Chess,’ and fearful that the young prodigy would further blemish his multi-million dollar brand by beating him again Carlsen viciously and maliciously retaliated against Niemann,” the suit, filed in the Eastern District of Missouri where the match took place, alleges.</p><p>Hans Niemann is represented by Oved & Oved and Gartner Firm.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>'The Rock' Film 'Black Adam' Top Global Box Office With $135 Million Worldwide Opening</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>CNBC</a>, <a href=#>Chessbase</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1orrSZqWinZ2Wu695wKWjnp%2BVmbm6edKunKxlnZa0r8HSZpqaqpyosq95xaipZmlgZXqutculoKimXaTDpr6MnJ%2Beq6NisKmxwK2gp59dlrmtscaaq6Knnqh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./difference-between-horse-and-pony.html><span>←</span><span>Difference between horse and pony</span></a>
