The show, of course, revolves around dating, in an attempt to create as many successful couples as possible by the end of the show. Singles are faced with the challenge of trying to find a match and fall in love. However, the catch is that those paired together have never seen each other face to face, forcing them to make a good judgment based on the emotional connection. This gives the contestants a chance to get to know each other on a deeper level before judging their physical appearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So far, there have been three seasons of the show that have all aired on Netflix, with the first airing in 2020. The show has proved to be incredibly popular, with the first season of the show pulling in over 30 million viewers, which is no mean feat. The third season, however, sparked even more interest after the only two marriages from season two imploded. Which begs the question, are fan-favorite married couple Alexa and Brennon still together today?</p><h2 id=alexa-and-brennon-had-a-successful-relationship-on-the-show>Alexa And Brennon Had A Successful Relationship On The Show</h2><p>Season 3 of Love Is Blind officially premiered on October 19th, 2022. As usual, fans quickly developed their favorite couples, with some including Raven and SK, as well as Alexa and Brennon (of course). Both of these couples quickly gained popularity among fans due to the chemistry between them and how well they got along.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alexa, who is the owner of an insurance agency, and Brennon, who is an engineer, paired up together and both appeared to get along incredibly well. Despite getting along so well, it appeared that the couple didn't quite agree on everything, especially in regard to parenting, where fans speculated Brennon seemed to display a bit of concern.</p><p>During later episodes of the season, it became abundantly clear to fans that the two shared quite big differences in terms of family background. The first example of this came when the two were discussing their parenting style together.</p><p>While Alexa tells Brennon that 'her family doesn't hold back', Brennon seems to express his concern: "With our kids, I'm definitely, like, Sit up straight for every meal. You know what I'm saying?". However, Alexa makes it clear that she doesn't understand at all. Awkward.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Love Is Blind Fans Think Zanab Jaffrey Is Trying Too Hard To Be The Season 3 Version Of Deepti">Love Is Blind Fans Think Zanab Jaffrey Is Trying Too Hard To Be The Season 3 Version Of Deepti</a></span></p><p>More family differences are later uncovered when the fan favorite couple finally meet each other's family and friends. While it is clear that <a href=#>Alexa comes from a more privileged background</a>, Brennon comes from quite the opposite.</p><p>It seems that this hasn't prevented romance from blossoming between the two.</p><h2 id=are-alexa-and-brennon-from-love-is-blind-season-3-still-together>Are Alexa and Brennon From Love Is Blind Season 3 Still Together?</h2><p>While the pair was clearly a fan favorite on the show, are they still together after the show has ended? While it may not be clear just from looking at social media, eagle-eyed fans finally got their answer during the reunion episode of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="Did Cole Tell The Love Is Blind Producers To Add In The Final Clip Of The Show?">Did Cole Tell The Love Is Blind Producers To Add In The Final Clip Of The Show?</a></span></p><p>During the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reunion episode</a>, the couple revealed that yes, they are in fact still together and going strong.

Colleen and Matt are still married, and often share loved-up snaps on social media for fans to see. The two even have plans to eventually move in together, however, no specific date was given.</p><p>Overall, that is two happy couples who have managed to build a successful marriage outside the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="4 Heartbreaking Moments From The Love Is Blind Finale And 4 Heartwarming Ones">4 Heartbreaking Moments From The Love Is Blind Finale And 4 Heartwarming Ones</a></span></p><p>However, there are also some couples who have not stayed together, including Zanab and Cole, Nancy and Bartise, and Raven and SK.</p><p>Despite not being able to make their relationships successful, the <a href=#>contestants still got paid for being on the show,</a> meaning it wasn't a complete waste of time despite things not ending in marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq51dlrmmxMBmmKecXZe%2FprrNqKVmnqKkum64zq%2BcZqGjYq%2Bttc2dZKysmaG5bsDOoJytoJWnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tnt-title-match-confirmed-for-12-6-aew-dynamite-updated-card.html><span>←</span><span>TNT Title Match Confirmed For 12/6 AEW Dynamite, Updated Card</span></a>
