We wanted the house to look like an old barn, something that had been here for decades, that was then converted into a house. But it also had to feel modern and relevant,” she said.</p><p>Prior to building the hilltop property, Kunis and Kutcher created separate Pinterest boards to help plot their ideas and designs. It didn’t take them long to realize that their ideas are perfectly in sync with each other.</p><p>“When we looked at each other's boards, 90 percent of the images we selected were the same, and most of the houses we pinned were designed by Howard,” Kutcher said.</p><p>Kunis added that building their dream home from the ground up was no joke because it could either make them or break them. And it obviously <a href=#>strengthened the couple’s relationship</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Backen shared what it was like putting Kunis and Kutcher’s vision to life with his modern farmhouse skills.</p><p>“Ashton and Mila are two of the smartest, most inquisitive people we've ever worked with. We talked about everything from beam sizes to the details of the cross bracing to the junctures of the wood planks and concrete. These are not the kinds of conversations we have with every client,” he said.</p><p>The couple’s property is reportedly powered by solar energy. They also had their soil and water tested to ensure that they are top quality. Kunis and Kutcher also employ Regenerative farming practices to ensure sustainability.</p><p>Charles, who also helped put Kunis and Kutcher’s vision to life, revealed that the actress was pregnant with her first child when they started their journey together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We spent months looking at materials and colors to find the right visual language. Our conversations were not just about the land and the architecture but also about the future of their family,” she said.</p><p>Today, Kunis and Kutcher already have two children.
