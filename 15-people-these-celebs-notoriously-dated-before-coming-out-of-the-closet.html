This is a term used to refer to a gay person dating or marrying someone of the opposite gender&nbsp;to hide the fact of his or her s*xuality especially when he or she feels as if the masses do not approve of same-s*x relationships. Most celebrities who take too long to come out probably don't want to admit that the heart wants what it wants, and often take time to confirm their feelings beyond a doubt.</p><p>It is also common to have "beard" relationships between celebrities in the same production franchises who date each other to create a buzz, which works well for a period since it earns them a huge following. However, as soon as they are through playing their roles, they come out of the closet and give us the shock of our lives. Some lose their "beards" and express their desires openly, while others continue in their heteros*xual relationships even with overwhelming rumors following them everywhere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, some people have observed that some celebrities have seen just how the tables have turned in recent years, where gay celebrities are receiving so much attention and support from all circles and decide they want a piece of the action. Therefore, such celebrities claim to come out of the closet, which they were not in to begin with, and do so because it will favor their careers.</p><p>Here is a list of celebrities who notoriously dated people of the opposite gender, only to shock us and end up coming out of the closet as gay.</p><h2 id=rebecca-de-alba-dated-ricky-martin><strong>Rebecca De Alba Dated Ricky Martin</strong></h2><p>Rebecca de Alba is a beautiful model and TV presenter from Mexico. She spent a few years in Colorado studying journalism and later went back to Mexico to work on several TV shows including her very own talk show called Un Nuevo DÃ­a. When she participated in the Miss Mexico beauty pageant, she came in second place, and her beauty was undeniably the reason she performed so well. Later she became Avon's spokesperson and the first Bulgari representative from Mexico.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rebecca is on this list because she dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ricky Martin</a>&nbsp;in an on-again off-again type of a relationship, for approximately 14 years. Although everyone knows Ricky Martin came out as gay, he described Rebecca in his book as "the perfect woman." Rebecca is now happily married to Michael Bednarsky. Since 2016, Ricky has been with his partner Jwan Yosef, a Swedish painter who currently lives in London and specializes in plastic arts.</p><h2 id=kassidy-cook-dated-tom-daley><strong>Kassidy Cook Dated Tom Daley</strong></h2><p>Kassidy Cook is an amazing diver, who has won numerous diving championships since 2007. She used to be a part of the United States national diving team, where she competed in the Olympics in 2012 and 2016, missing the 2014 Olympics by only 0.4 points. In order to continue in her winning ways, Cook spends at least five hours training every day for six days every week. Currently, Cook is a student at Stanford University.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cook is here because, at some point, her friendship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Daley</a> was more than just the average friendship, since it seemed as if they were dating. Although Tom has denied any romantic relationship with Cook, everyone including the British press could clearly see something was going on between these two. However, Tom came out as gay on YouTube a few years&nbsp;ago and just this year married Dustin Lance Black, an American film director, screenwriter, and producer.</p><h2 id=robert-pattinson-dated-kristen-stewart><strong>Robert Pattinson Dated Kristen Stewart</strong></h2><p>If you were a fan of Twilight, you know how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Pattinson</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kristen Stewart</a> looked perfect together. This film series established Pattinson as one of the most bankable and highest paid actors in Hollywood, with TIME magazine naming him one of the top 100 Most Influential People in The World in 2010.</p><p>Although their romance began on set and they hardly ever talked about their relationship offstage, these two were clearly in love, judging from the numerous photos we saw of them together and the eyewitness accounts of those around them. The first time Kristen acknowledged there was indeed something between them was when the Huffington Post published images of her and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rupert Sanders</a> showing affection to each other when issuing an apology to Pattinson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These two officially broke up and went their separate ways. Pattinson got into a relationship with FKA Twigs and got engaged in 2015, whereas Kristen recently came out as a lesbian.</p><h2 id=christine-taylor-dated-neil-patrick-harris><strong>Christine Taylor Dated Neil Patrick Harris</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christine Taylor</a> started acting back in 1989, when she was just 18 years old, appearing in Hey Dude and later in a few episodes of Saved by the Bell, Life Goes On, Murphy Brown, and even in Friends. Some of the films she has featured in include The Wedding Singer, Zoolander, License To Wed, and The First Time among others.</p><p>Christine dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Patrick Harris</a> for a period, but they broke it off. Christine later married <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Stiller</a>, a celebrity she met on set, and they continued to work together on a number of films. These two have two children together, a daughter and a son, but earlier this year they decided to split up.</p><p>Neil Patrick Harris, on the other hand, came out as gay a few years back. He is now married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Burtka</a>, a fellow actor. Pamela Fryman, one of the directors of How I Met Your Mother officiated the wedding back in 2014.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dania-ramirez-dated-zachary-quinto><strong>Dania Ramirez Dated Zachary Quinto</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dania Ramirez</a> is a film and TV actress who has appeared in films such as She Hate Me, X-Men: The Last Stand, Illegal Tender, American Reunion, and Mojave, among others. She has also been part of great TV productions including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Sopranos, Heroes, Devious Maids, as well as in the ongoing Once Upon a Time.</p><p>Dania is on this list because she once dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachary Quinto</a>, but they never made strides towards getting married.

For his work in film, he has received three Academy Award nominations for Best Sound but is yet to win a single one. The marriage between these two lasted between 1996 and 1999 when Metcalfe apparently left de Rossi to be with her brother's wife.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to an interview, de Rossi explained how her brother and his long-term girlfriend had just gotten married and moved into an apartment in the same complex where Metcalfe and her husband were living in. Metcalfe left de Rossi and soon afterward his brother's wife sabotaged their marriage to unite with him. De Rossi and her brother moved in together and she claimed she started feeling as if she was a lesbian.</p><p>De Rossi is now married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellen DeGeneres</a> and appears to have completely moved on from the heartbreak.</p><h2 id=jussie-smollett-dated-raven-symone>Jussie Smollett Dated Raven-Symone</h2><p>Most people know him as Jamal Lyon, owing to just how popular Empire is, but his real name is Jussie Smollett, and he has been acting since he was five years old, appearing in commercials as well as in films. Some notable films he has been&nbsp;in include The Mighty Ducks, The Skinny, and this year's Alien: Covenant. Although Jussie is yet to win a major award for his acting, it appears to be just a matter of time before he wins one, because he is a great actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jussie Smollett is on this list because he once dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Raven-Symone</a>, a singer, songwriter, producer, TV personality, and actress. Some of the most popular TV shows Raven has been on include The Cosby Show, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, and That's So Raven. These two celebrities dated a few years back, but it's so interesting that both of them are now gay.</p><h2 id=carolyn-moos-dated-jason-collins><strong>Carolyn Moos Dated Jason Collins</strong></h2><p>Fans of women's basketball need no introduction to Carolyn Moss. This tall lady used to play basketball in college as well as on the professional scene, but she retired and is now a personal trainer and nutritional consultant.

Tiffany received a lot of attention for hit songs including the cover of the 1967 original of&nbsp;I Think We're Alone Now, which she released in 1987 and became a downright teen anthem. Later on, she ventured into acting and appeared in films including Necrosis, Mega Piranha, and Mega Python vs. Gatoroid.</p><p>Tiffany makes it to this list because she dated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jonathan Knight</a>, who is also a singer, who used to belong to the sensational boy band called New Kids on the Block.
