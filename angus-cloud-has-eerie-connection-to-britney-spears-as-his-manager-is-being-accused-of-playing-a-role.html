He added that Angus still owed him "outstanding management commissions from Angus totaling over $60,000.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Was Angus Cloud Before Euphoria?</a></span></p><p>Britney Spears’ parents have been vocal about their belief that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam contributed to their daughter’s breakdown in the early 2000s </a>and abused her during her conservatorship, and the manager has gone on record saying he’s not surprised if Britney blames him.</p><p>"If she hates me after she's free I won't blame her," Sam tweeted after a court hearing in 2021 about Britney’s conservatorship.

Rather, she said they’re waiting on the results of an autopsy to confirm if he died from an accidental overdose or another unknown cause.</p><p>“Social media posts have suggested his death was intentional. I want you to know that is not the case,” she wrote. “I only know that he put his head on the desk where he was working on art project’s, fell asleep and didn’t wake up.”</p><p>“We may find out that he overdosed accidentally and tragically, but it’s abundantly clear that he did not intend to check out of this world,” she continued.
