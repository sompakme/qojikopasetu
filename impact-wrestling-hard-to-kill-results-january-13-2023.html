Josh wraps the chain around his knee and smashes Bully in the face for two, then John Skyler and Jason Hotch run out and attack Alexander. They help Bully hit a 3D, but he only gets two. Bully calls for some tables after Alexander is zip-tied to the ropes, but Tommy Dreamer heads to the ring and calls Bully a son of a bitch.
