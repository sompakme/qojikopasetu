His first public role was on the now-defunct reality show, The Princes Of Malibu, with his family. He has appeared on Keeping Up With The Kardashians&nbsp;with his ex-step siblings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brandon is also one half of the musical group, Brandon and Leah, of which with his wife, Leah Jenner is also a member.
