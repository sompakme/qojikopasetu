Subsequently, they say Tekashi went on to blow off the concerts without any prior warning.</p><p>Court documents reveal that Tekashi reached out to the app in January to reach a new deal. The company alleges he tried to reschedule the concerts for later that month. Despite agreeing to his suggestion, Streamusic alleges that the rapper once again ghost them ahead of the rescheduled concerts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, the app is hoping to receive a million-dollar payout for breach of contract.</p><p>As per TMZ, Tekashi’s team hasn’t confirmed or denied the allegations.

Tekashi has not been served with any legal papers,” his attorney said.</p><p>Interestingly, this isn’t the only time Tekashi has bailed on a scheduled performance.

Tickets ranged between $500 to $3,000.</p><p>Tekashi 6ix9ine only recently <a href=#>announced his return to music</a> after a series of legal troubles. Earlier this month, he teased new music through his Instagram page.</p><p>“I hope everybody enjoyed there 15 minutes,” he captioned the post. “THE DEMON IS BACK APRIL 15TH.
