While she already owns multiple residences in California, the makeup mogul is reportedly budling the mansion of her dream – or should we say, mega mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Kylie Cosmetics founder has owned a vacant lot in California for several years, and only recent broke ground. According to reports, she’s building a luxury mansion that will presumably become the main residence for her and her children, 5-year-old Stormi and 1-year-old Aire.</p><p>Although few details are confirmed about Kylie’s mega mansion, here’s what we know so far.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS Products Praised For Saving A Woman’s Life As It Reaches $4 Billion Valuation</a></span></p><h2 id=kylie-is-building-a-home-next-to-kris-amp-khloe>Kylie Is Building A Home Next To Kris & Khloe</h2><p>Kylie is already close with her neighbors, as her mega mansion is being constructed on a neighboring property to the huge lot <a href=#>Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian are currently building side-by-side mansions</a> on.</p><p>Kris and Khloe paid $10 million each in April 2021 to secure the property, and their next-door homes were finished this April.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they property boasts two residences, including separate pools, Kris and Khloe will share a driveway. Khloe got the bigger of the homes at 18,000 square feet, while Kris’ mansion is slightly smaller at 17,000 square feet.</p><p>While Kylie’s new mansion will be neighboring her mom and sister’s homes, it’ll stand as its own residence with a private driveway.</p><h2 id=she-bought-the-property-for-15-million>She Bought The Property For $15 Million</h2><p>Interestingly, Kylie bought their property before Kris and Khloe secured their plot of land, even though their homes have already been finished. Kylie reportedly spent $15 million on the property in 2020. It was previously owned by Miley Cyrus, who purchased it in 2015 to use as a ranch for her horses.</p><p>The singer eventually sold the residence in 2018 for $5 million to an undisclosed buyer, who tore down the existing ranch and did a series of renovations, before profiting big by selling the property to Kylie two years later.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, it was reported that plans had been approved for an 18,000 square foot mansion to go up on the lot. The approved plans included a “12-car garage, guesthouse, barn, guardshack for a full-time security detail, sports court and a pool,” <a href=#>Dirt</a><a href=#> reports</a>.</p><h2 id=the-total-time-for-construction>The Total Time For Construction</h2><p>Despite owning the property since 2020, Kylie only broke ground earlier this year, reports say. <a href=#>Photos published by the U.S. Sun</a> in February show a large structure under construction.</p><p>The publication says a second story was recently added to the structure, which will be 18,000 square feet in total. The guest house will be an additional 1,200 square feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the project could be years away from completing. LA real estate agent Tony Mariotti, who’s also the CEO of RubyHome Luxury Real Estate, told The Sun the mega mansion is as complicated as building a hotel.</p><p>"They are bigger. I know that's obvious, but bigger homes just take longer. For example, that foundation, with the subterranean garage is some serious business,” he explained. “Not only is it huge, but it is way more complex than a typical foundation.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Kanye West’s Presidential Campaign Received “Zero Donations” Recently As He Struggles With Finances</a></span></p><p>"Interior materials are not off-the-shelf products found in your local hardware store,” Mariotti went on. “The marble or stone they use, and the carpet they use, are unique and most likely sourced from around the world.”</p><p>"If you run out of something or have difficulty with the materials, that'll cause a delay,” he added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariotti suspects the mega mansion will take years to complete. For now, Kylie is calling her $36.5 million Hidden Hills property her main residence.</p><h2 id=the-backlash-over-her-mega-mansion>The Backlash Over Her Mega Mansion</h2><p>While some fans are eager for more details of Kylie’s new mega mansion, others have <a href=#>criticized the makeup mogul for her decision to build a new home</a>, considering how many others she currently owns.</p><p>In one Reddit thread titled How many houses does this woman need?", many of the comments attack Kylie and her family’s real estate decisions.</p><p>"Why do they keep building homes in the same spot?” One comment said. “If I had that kind of money I’d have dream homes all over the states and Europe. They’re such townies for such rich people."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Kim, Kris, and Khloe have all built homes, so out of pure boredom, toxicity, and excess, Kylie’s gonna build a 'dream home' herself to compete with her family,” another person wrote.</p><p>"I bet she doesn’t even really want a new house, and that she’ll barely be involved in the building/design process,” a different critic argued. “But these women are obsessed with familial competition, and they have much, much more money than sense. So of course this is her next move."</p><p>For now, Kylie hasn’t addressed the backlash over her mega mansion. But if the reports are true, it could be a while before she even moves into the luxury residence.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Launches New Energy Drink With Alani Nu, But The Idea Could Tank</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The U.S. Sun</a>, <a href=#>House Beautiful</a>, <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmahnaKawG6x1Z6psqyYnruoedaeZKSmn6x6oq7Orqtmo6mhtqZ5yZ6lp52iqHq0scKrnK1lk5a5qrLOq6WimV2isqitjKaYp6uZpLtw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-controversial-movies-that-were-banned.html><span>←</span><span>10 Controversial Movies That Were Banned</span></a>
