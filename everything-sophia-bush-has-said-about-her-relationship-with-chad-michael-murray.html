During an interview on Michael Rosenbaum‘s Inside of You podcast, the actress said <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating co-stars isn't that strange</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You realize that everyone you’ve ever met in this business has, like, dated everyone else. When you spend 100 hours a week on set and you don’t even get home for eight hours to sleep, like, yeah, I’m not surprised that every 20-year-old on a set has dated every other 20-year-old on a set. We act like it’s not common and it’s wildly common. Some of our favorite celebrity couples are people who married the fourth costar they dated."</p><p>Apart from Chad Micahel Murray, Sophie Bush also dated One Tree Hill‘s James Lafferty and Austin Nichols.</p><h2 id=sophia-bush-revealed-she-didn-39-t-really-want-to-marry-chad-michael-murray><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sophia Bush Revealed She Didn't Really Want To Marry Chad Michael Murray</span></h2><p>Back in 2018, Sophia Bush was asked about her relationship with Murray on What Happens Live With Andy Cohen. There she revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she didn't really want to marry her co-star</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was not a thing I actually really wanted to do, but you know, it’s cool.

And when you have bosses telling you that you’re the only person who gets a person to work on time, and 200 people either get to see their kids at night or they don’t because our days start on time."</p><h2 id=sophia-bush-39-s-environment-contributed-to-the-relationship-with-chad-michael-murray><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Sophia Bush's Environment Contributed To The Relationship With Chad Michael Murray</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actress revealed that she had a lot of changes she was going through at the time, and that adapting to fame wasn't easy for her. She also admitted that the euphoria of being on television and hanging out with her co-star a lot contributed to the relationship. Here's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what she said</a>:</p><p>"Being a super nerdy kid and suddenly you’re on TV and all this stuff is happening and one of the cool people you work with thinks you’re awesome, there’s really base brain stuff there. I think that for me, it took me a long time to do the kind of inventory you’re talking about in the after-effect.

Bush <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up about it by saying</a>:</p><p>"They made practice of taking advantage of people’s personal lives and not just for me and for my ex — for other actors on the show who would share, like as you do when you get close to people, deeply personal things that were happening in their lives and they would wind up in storylines. It wasn’t okay. It was opportunistic and ugly and when you run a show, you’re like a parent. You’re supposed to protect your flock and it was the opposite of that. And I imagine that was hard for him as well. It was a very ugly situation on their part. I think they kind of lived for the drama."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sophia-bush-said-she-wouldn-39-t-talk-about-chad-michael-murray-anymore><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sophia Bush Said She Wouldn't Talk About Chad Michael Murray Anymore</span></h2><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview on Michael Rosenbaum's podcast Inside of You</a> from last year, the actress said that she wouldn't talk about her ex-husband anymore as her words tend to get twisted. Here's what Bush said:</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="One Tree Hill's Legacy Has Been Tarnished By These Serious Allegations">One Tree Hill's Legacy Has Been Tarnished By These Serious Allegations</a></span></p><p>"Oh, I'm not going to talk about him.

Here's what Bush said in the same interview about why reliving the past isn't worth her time:</p><p>"I think you have to, like, laugh at who you used to be, but when people ask me about history that involves someone else … it's not worth my time. It's not a place where I harbor ill will or anything."</p><h2 id=sophia-bush-is-focusing-on-her-career-and-not-chad-michael-murray><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Sophia Bush Is Focusing On Her Career And Not Chad Michael Murray</span></h2><p>Lastly, the actress made a very valid point by saying that she was very young at the time, and she has achieved so much since her One Tree Hill days. "I'm like, 'Do you want to talk about a dumb thing you did when you were 21, when you were essentially a senior in college?' Like, I have this whole other career."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's clear that to Sophie Bush, that chapter of her life has been over for a long time.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Did The ‘One Tree Hill’ Cast Actually Get Along?">Did The ‘One Tree Hill’ Cast Actually Get Along?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWiv4yspqmgmZZ6o8HSoWSsmZmZeqKuzq6rZqCVp3qzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMsKCtoF2YtaKwjKagnKCRmrluudSrqZqxXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./v%C3%ADctor-navas-player-profile-2023.html><span>←</span><span>Vctor Navas - Player profile 2023</span></a>
