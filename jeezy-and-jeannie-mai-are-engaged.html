What Jeannie didn’t know is that Jay was planning to propose,” Mai’s rep said to the publication. “Instead, Jay decided to bring Vietnam to Jeannie with a surprise quarantine date night in his home filled with Vietnamese food and decor.”&nbsp;In November 2018, Mai and Jeezy began to date after they met on the set of Mai’s talk show The Real.</p><p>Mai was previously married but split from her ex in 2017. Upon meeting Jeezy, she said it was an instant connection. “Immediately that was a magnetic attraction. We are very attracted to each other’s passions to serve,” Mai said to the publication. “So because we have a mutual joy of having purpose, we’re going to find a way to do that together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BypsbYZpinnF2fsqK6zaKcZqWRnnqosdNmnKefkZyypXmVcG9wbmlk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alexander-mattison-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Alexander Mattison Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
