He was found pressed in between his brick mailbox and security fence early Sunday morning.</p><p>Yelchin was on his way to meet friends for a rehearsal, but his pals grew worried after he didn’t show up. They drove to his house, where they discovered his body. His vehicle, a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee was part of a massive recall.</p><p>According to <a href=#>CBS News</a>, 1.1 million of 2014 and 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokees were recalled because the new electronic gearshift, or e-shift, made it difficult to put the car into park, drive or reverse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>On Monday, June 20, Jeep released a statement offering their condolences for Yelchin, but stated that it is too early to blame his death on the company’s vehicle.</p><p>“FCA US extends its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Mr. Yelchin,” a representative for Jeep told<i> TheWrap</i>. “The company will be conducting a thorough investigation of this tragic incident. It is premature to speculate on its cause at this time.”</p><p>Since his tragic passing, many of Yelchin’s famous friends have taken to social media to honor his memory.</p><p>“Devastated by our friend’s loss,” his <i>Star Trek</i> costar <b>Zoe Saldana</b> wrote of the late actor, who played Chekov in the three-part movie reboot. “We are mourning his passing and celebrating the beautiful spirit that he was. #RIPAnton.”</p><p>Along with his role in the <i>Star Trek</i> series, Yelchin was known for acting in movies such as <i>Like Crazy</i> and <i>Charlie Bartlett</i>. He starred alongside <b>Justin Timberlake</b> in 2006’s <i>Alpha Dog</i>. He will appear posthumously in the third <i>Star Trek</i> film, <i>Star Trek Beyond</i>, which is set for release in July.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapqSku27FxKWaoaGeYrGqscNmrqKsmJ67bq2MpqCnraSaerCyjJ%2BpnpmbYq6kr8idnKesXax%2FcnyWbm1o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tekashi-6ix9ine-sued-for-2-million-after-bailing-on-concerts.html><span>←</span><span>Tekashi 6ix9ine Sued For $2 Million After Bailing On Concerts</span></a>
