Companies that have a blog available, typically generate the most sales. Some bloggers are brands running successful social media channels.</p><p>And all of them need a manager responsible for content generation.</p><p>So what are a blog manager’s responsibilities, and how do you become one?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did the role of a blog manager appear?</h2><p>Blogs are increasingly popular and widely read by millions of people worldwide. However, there needs to be a regular content stream to keep a <a href=#>blog current and engaging.</a></p><p>This can be daunting to a single, regular blogger working independently.</p><p>An overall theme for the blog must be identified. Suitable topics, subjects, and possibly a project will need to be mapped out and placed into the writing and posting schedule.</p><p>Everything within the blog must adhere to the blog’s brand identity. A blog manager is necessary for all of these tasks.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What does a blog manager do?</h2><li><strong>Coordinates the stream of content&nbsp;</strong></li><p>The schedule for posts must be set and organized so that writers can be found and instructed on what to write about. The brand that owns the blog will wish to create an experience for its consumers within the provided content.&nbsp;</p><li><strong>Synchronizes visuals with the corporation’s voice and identity&nbsp;</strong></li><p>Branded images must fit a corporate color scheme. Using a picture background remover of <a href=#>Depositphotos.com</a> is perfect for a <a href=#>business</a> blog, in terms of adjusting the necessary visuals with branded backgrounds. Likewise, images with hues and tones that fit an Instagram feed’s color scheme would suit an individual blogger’s identity.</p><li><strong>Liaises with writers&nbsp;</strong></li><p>The content manager leads teams to brainstorm new content ideas, curates images, videos, and blog posts. Along with liaising with writers, the blog manager works closely with the blogger or brand they are representing. The blogger needs to be updated about the scheduled creative ideas, as they’re creating content themselves for social media. The writers, manager, and blogger need to work harmoniously, which is within the remit of the blog manager’s role.</p><li><strong>Keeps the blog’s voice constant&nbsp;</strong></li><p>While managing a blog, all writing must be of the same tone across multiple authors, be it formal corporate content or entertainment blog. In addition, the voice of the individual blogger you represent and manage, or corporate identity, also must be adhered to. This helps keep the blog authentic and so that it appeals to the correct audience.</p><li><strong>Generates fresh ideas</strong></li><p>Blog managers are creative individuals who form original, new ideas. They keep on top of trends within the blog’s sector. Trends constantly change and need to be followed to keep identifying with the blog’s readers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What do you need to know to work with bloggers?</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Hard skills</h3><p>To work successfully with bloggers, a blog manager is required to have considerable knowledge of spreadsheet programs like Excel. Online tables need to be created and maintained containing various formulas, including cost-per-view and cost-per-click.</p><p>Besides, making editorial corrections to advertising content and individual posts is essential to keep the uninterrupted concept flow.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Soft skills</h3><p>A content manager needs to know good practices concerning business communication and sending emails to multiple people without enduring any trouble that may arise. Solving issues and dealing with crises calmly is also one of essential abilities.</p><p>Throughout work, a manager needs good oral and presentation skills to communicate content ideas and present them to the public.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Social media skills</h3><p>A blog manager has to understand the statistics, particularly concerning Instagram. The number of clicks and engagement rates must be calculated and interpreted. Excellent communication skills help in working with bloggers and translating their ethos into their blogs. Moreover, empathy and other personal traits boost communication with the blogger and ensure they are happy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What do blog managers earn?</h2><p>The blog manager’s salary largely depends on the size of the company or individual they are working for. On average, blog managers can earn <a href=#>$69,000 per year</a> within the United States.</p><p>The maximum salary amount can reach up to $136,000 per year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How can you become a blog manager?</h2><p>A good way to begin is to search for an online agency that caters to content writers and managers. There are several of these online, and you can submit a proposal in response to a job vacancy.</p><p>In addition, many organizations and individuals advertise with an agency to hire blog managers alongside content writers.</p><p>When you write your proposal, do not try to do it in a stiff, overly-formal manner. While it is good to be formal and professional, prospective employers want to see that you also have a human touch, as this will relate to their blog readers.</p><p>Try writing for blogs also. A good blog manager will be a good writer and an editor. Any creative ideas you have, keep note of them. You never know when your ideas will be needed.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h3><p>A blog manager is responsible for the overall feel and character of a blog. Also, they must manage bloggers to keep a consistent flow of content to their blog.</p><p>They help bloggers manage the writing schedule for fresh content and curate that content. Bloggers will no longer become overwhelmed by their schedule demands for new and pertinent content with a blog manager.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCz1KKbnmWkpHqjscKopKKml2LAtq%2FCnqqsnqWheqO4zqBkppmelrSmvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./6-best-eco-friendly-dishwasher-detergents.html><span>←</span><span>6 Best Eco-Friendly Dishwasher Detergents</span></a>
