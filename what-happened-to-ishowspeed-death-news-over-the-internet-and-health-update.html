IShowSpeed Death Or Alive<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Darren Watkins Jr., aka Ishowspeed, a famous young Youtuber and streamer, is not shot and is alive in his home. All the rumors are baseless and do not reflect any reality.</p><p>“YouTuber called “IShowSpeed” found dead by gunshot wound yesterday at 2 AM at a gas station.”&nbsp;Channel 46 News&nbsp;made breaking news on their page without proof of IShowSpeed death.</p><p>And Channel 46 News is just one in the bunch. Many media and publications have already covered his death news, stating he died this morning of a gunshot wound. But this is not true. He is not dead.</p><p>Ishowpeed posted a video on his YouTube channel to express his annoyance and displeasure.

The truth is that IShowSpeed did not get shot and is very much alive.</p><p>The guy posted a two and half hour streaming video on his youtube after getting freed from an arrest. Due to fake calling the police, real Ohio cops showed up at his doorstep and arrested him yesterday. But it turned out he did not phone any cops; it was his friend. And thus, after the misunderstanding was cleared, he got freed.</p><p>When one YouTubers aired a video of his arrest, he claimed that there had been a gunshot or what sounded like a gunshot after the camera had moved away from him. This is how all of his false death news began.</p><p>People might begin to panic without understanding what transpired at any time.
