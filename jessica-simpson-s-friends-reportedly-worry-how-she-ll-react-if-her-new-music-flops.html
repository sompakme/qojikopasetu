She’s released a few albums in her career, though 2008’s Do You Know was considered a commercial flop.</p><p>Jessica hasn’t put out new music in over a decade, with her last album Happy Christmas releasing in 2010. Since then, she’s been focused on her fashion line and raising her family, though she seemingly now feels it’s time to get back in the industry.</p><p>However, the same source warns that Jessica isn’t familiar with what the music industry looks like nowadays, so there’s concern any new music could falter like her last couple of albums.</p><p>“The music industry has changed completely since Jess was a big star,” they explained. “The days when she could sell 3 million albums are long behind her. Really, she’s a nostalgia act at this point.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=there-rsquo-s-concern-jessica-could-have-a-relapse>There’s Concern Jessica Could Have A Relapse</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar50333215.jpg><p>The source continued to explain that, given Jessica’s allegedly past issue with substances and alcohol, those close to her fear a relapse if her new projects aren’t received well by fans.</p><p>“If this comeback doesn’t work out, there are real fears she’s going to fall into depression and go back to her destructive habits,” they explained. “[Her husband] Eric and her folks are trying to get Jess to manage her expectations — and are monitoring her closely.”</p><p>It’s not only rumors – Jessica has been open about her past demons, giving credence to the source’s concerns. In her 2020 memoir Open Book, Simpson <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">admitted to struggling with alcohol and pill addiction</a>, revealing that she turned to substances to cope with past trauma and stress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar48226986.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="John Mayer’s Career Was Never The Same After His Comments About Jessica Simpson&nbsp;">John Mayer’s Career Was Never The Same After His Comments About Jessica Simpson&nbsp;</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans went after John Mayer in a major way after his broken relationship to Jessica Simpson.</p><p>She candidly shared her journey towards sobriety, including a pivotal moment in 2017 when she realized her drinking had become unmanageable, leading her to seek professional help and ultimately get sober.</p><p>Rumors have often suggested that she attended rehab, though Simpson clarified that her path to recovery involved therapy and support from family and friends rather than a formal rehab stay.</p><p>These struggles have impacted her career, causing periods of professional hiatus, and have also influenced her personal life, including her marriage to Eric Johnson, with whom she shares three kids.</p><p>Despite the challenges, Jessica has worked to rebuild her career and maintain her sobriety, using her platform to raise awareness about addiction and recovery.
