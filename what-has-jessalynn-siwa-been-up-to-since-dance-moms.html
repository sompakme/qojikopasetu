You’ll be right if you guessed if she was related to popular YouTube sensation, JoJo Siwa. Jessalynn Siwa is mother of the talented American dancer, singer, actress and YouTube star, JoJo Siwa. Jessalynn (Lombardi) married to Tom Siwa, is a mother of two, a talented dancer, a dance instructor for children and owner of a dance studio in Nebraska (originally Iowa), Underground Dance Factory before it was shut down in 2016. She also ran the Just Dance Co studio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything James Lafferty Has Been Up To Since 'One Tree Hill'</a></span></p><p>Jessalynn's TV debut came when she and JoJo, <a href=#>joined Dance Moms in its fifth season</a> as a duo. Since then, the proud mom has mentioned in interviews that Jojo took to dancing at an early age so it is no surprise that the youngster is now known for her remarkable dancing skills. The Apple really did not fall far from the tree. Now that Jessalynn’s Dance Moms day are behind her, what has she been up to? Keep scrolling to find out.</p><h2 id=she-has-continued-to-be-there-for-her-kids><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>She Has Continued To Be There For Her Kids</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to JoJo, Jessalynn is also a mom to <a href=#>son Jayden </a>and regardless of her fame, this will always be her most important job. Since her time on Dance Moms came to an end, Jessalynn has continued to be there for her children. The proud mama constantly shows off her love for Jayden and JoJo on social media and going by what we see, Jessalynn will always, always have her kids’ backs.</p><h2 id=she-works-as-jojo-39-s-manager><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She Works As JoJo's Manager</span></h2><p>The mom of two also manages her daughter’s budding career and oversees JoJo's scheduling. Young as JoJo may be, the 18-year-old "Boomerang" singer has a lot on her plate, so it’s no surprise she’ll need help with her day-to-day living. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Once speaking to USA Today,</a> Jessalynn admitted that managing JoJo could get overwhelming sometimes and well, we won't say we're surprised. Judging from all the big career moves JoJo has been making with her YouTube, her consumer deal with Nickelodeon, and her Peacock TV show Siwas Dance Pop Revolution, amidst a great number of other things, it is safe to say momager Jessalynn is killing it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Jada Pinkett Smith Has Been Up To Since The August Alsina Drama</a></span></p><h2 id=jessalyn-has-her-own-podcast><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jessalyn Has Her Own Podcast</span></h2><p>Jessalynn keeps growing her daughter's brand but that’s not to say she’s neglecting her own dreams and aspirations. The former dancer is maximizing her popularity to the fullest by going into things that interest her. In June 2020, Jessalynn launched her podcast show Success With Jess, where she shares business and career tips. The mom of two also has a YouTube channel with the same name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continues to engage her fans and listeners by releasing new episodes on both her podcast and YouTube weekly. On both platforms, Jessalynn covers subjects like how her family came into the limelight, career success tips and sharing family portraits featuring her husband Tom, who leads a rather low-key life. With all of this and more Jess has kept her legion of fans entertained and it's no surprise they keep coming back for more.</p><h2 id=she-rsquo-s-on-jojo-39-s-new-show><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>She’s On JoJo's New Show</span></h2><p><a href=#>JoJo's new show Siwas Dance Pop Revolution</a> is now available on Peacock TV and fans can't wait to see what the youngster has in store. But while we can expect it to mainly highlight JoJo's life as a dancer, her mom will also be featured on the show. It is not yet entirely clear what in capacity Jessalynn will be serving, but according to the trailer, the proud mom will be teaming up with her daughter on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Vinessa Shaw Been Up to Since Starring in 'Hocus Pocus'?</a></span></p><h2 id=she-started-a-rhinestone-brand><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>She Started A Rhinestone Brand</span></h2><p>If you're following Jessalynn on Instagram, you must have noticed that she has a big love for rhinestones and things that sparkle. It was therefore only fitting that she would eventually launch a business in that line. Jessalynn is now the proud owner of Bling Bitz Rhinestones, a brand that adorns objects with beautiful stones, taking it from basic to, you know, extraordinary.</p><h2 id=jessalynn-is-a-strong-support-system-for-her-family><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jessalynn Is A Strong Support System For Her Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is Jessalynn actively involved in her children’s careers, she is also an active support system for JoJo, Jayden and also her husband Tom. <a href=#>After being cast on Dancing With The Stars</a>, JoJo revealed in one episode that her family would be in the audience to support her but warned her partner from looking at her mom’s face because she ‘makes weird faces when I’m performing’. JoJo alluded that having her mom and the rest of the family present was really helpful and encouraged her to perform even better.</p><p>Jessalynn is also quite instrumental to how confident JoJo has grown with her sexuality. <a href=#>When the teenager came out to her fans</a>, she stated that her mom had known about her sexual orientation 2 years before and was completely supportive of her decision to come out to the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So whether it is managing her home, a very busy daughter's career or pursuing her own dreams, Jessalynn is sure keeping extremely busy these days. This is clearly a far cry from her Dance Moms days of just showcasing her talented daughter's skills to the world.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Everything Hilarie Burton Has Been Up Since Her Stint As Peyton Sawyer On 'One Tree Hill'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYremv9Kao7KmnmLAqsPAZqypZaSkerS1zZycZpyRo7CmecyopKxn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-the-cast-of-the-wb-series-popular.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To The Cast Of The WB Series Popular?</span></a>
