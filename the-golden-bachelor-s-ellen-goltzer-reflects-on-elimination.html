I’m so ready to find my forever person, I wasn’t ready for so long, but I’m so ready now!”</p><p>She went on to say that saying goodbye to Gerry, 72, was “not an easy thing” for her to do. “I was falling in love and I hadn’t felt those kinds of feelings for a guy in years,” she wrote.</p><p>Gerry sent Ellen home during Thursday’s rose ceremony along with <a href=#><strong>Sandra Mason</strong> and <strong>Susan Noles</strong></a>. Earlier in the episode, Ellen confessed that she was falling in love with Gerry and could see him fitting into her life after filming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Golden-Bachelor-Ellen-Goltzer-Reflects-on-Heartbreaking-Elimination.jpg><p>“I feel like a weight is off my shoulders with you. I feel like it’s a team,” Ellen told Gerry during the group date. “I can’t wait to have my children, my best friend Roberta [meet you] — I know they would adore you as much as I do.” (Roberta died sometime after The Golden Bachelor began filming.)</p><p>Gerry was touched by Ellen’s words, but he ultimately decided to send her home, leaving <strong><a href=#>Leslie Fhima</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Theresa Nist</a></strong> and<strong> Faith Martin</strong> as his final three women. After the rose ceremony, Gerry offered to walk Ellen out of the mansion and told her that eliminating her was “<a href=#>the most difficult decision</a>” he’d made in his journey so far. “I hope you stay positive,” he added. “Because that’s you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Golden-Bachelor-Ellen-Goltzer-Reflects-on-Heartbreaking-Elimination-Gerry-Turner.jpg><p>Ellen seemed grateful for the conversation, but she later admitted she was shocked by Gerry’s choice. “I just thought he was The One,” she told the cameras.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the heartbreak, however, Ellen said filming The Golden Bachelor gave her the confidence to keep looking for romance elsewhere. “This experience has been one of the best experiences of my life,” she explained. “I have a lot more optimism about love and the possibility of finding love at this stage in my life.”</p><p>The Golden Bachelor airs on ABC Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2cvK2wxKdkm5mTnbKtu9GsZJ6knJq7brPOpauznaJiv6ayy56aratdpLtuscuipKKmkam2sLqO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./princess-charlotte-s-style-evolution-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Princess Charlottes Style Evolution: Photos</span></a>
