Most recently, screenwriter Simon Kinberg (Sherlock Holmes) had taken a pass at the Ouija script under the supervision of McG, who envisioned it as a big-budget Jumanji-like family fantasy, but apparently to no avail.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4c80fbe7410c38d6dba479953c822290-4-0-0@published data-word-count=74>Insiders say that Bay and McG are taking meetings with other studios next week to drum up interest. (Paramount Pictures, with whom producer Bay has an obvious longstanding relationship from directing Hasbro’s Transformers franchise, is said to have passed on taking over the project.) However, it’s not inconceivable that if another studio were to come aboard, a newly cost-conscious Universal might be less spooked by its considerable budget and stay on as a co-financier.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4c80fbe7410c38d6dba479953c822290-5-0-0@published data-word-count=103>But for now, the studio that has laid out so much money for the enormously expensive Hasbro production <a href=#>Battleship</a> isn’t blinking, and is opting to pay Hasbro the $5 million penalty for dropping a project as laid out in their 2008 deal. As one talent agent familiar with the project’s development explains, “This is how they beat you into submission and make you realize no one but no one wants to make this movie [at that price]. They just did it to Ron Howard with The Dark Tower: ‘Don’t let us stand in your way! Go find someone willing to write the check.’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-4c80fbe7410c38d6dba479953c822290-6-0-0@published data-word-count=4>1234567890 GOOD BYE, indeed.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Universal Drops Its Ouija Movie</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWloamdgbXywwcijmJian5a%2FpavMqK2inY%2BZsqKwjaGrpqQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./preston-boothe-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Preston Boothe Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</span></a>
