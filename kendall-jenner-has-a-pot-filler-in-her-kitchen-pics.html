The model recently walked<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Architectural Digest</a> around her <a href=#>expansive California home</a> in a YouTube video accompanying her September 2020 cover story and revealed that <a href=#>the kitchen</a> is one of her favorite spaces in the entire home, especially thanks to one convenient gadget.</p><p>“This is most definitely the most-used room in the house,” the 24-year-old reality star said as she walked into her kitchen. “We are in here almost every single day and night. I <a href=#>make dinner</a> with my friends most of the time.”</p><p>The space, which features dark green cabinetry, marble countertops, a separate island and gold faucets, is so inviting that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star said it’s inspired her to cook more. “I never knew that a certain kitchen could make you want to cook so much,” she said, noting that she “never” used the kitchen in her previous home.</p><p>“I got here and this kitchen just, like, makes me want to cook and bake,” Jenner continued.</p><p>As for the color palette, the reality star said she was inspired to coat her kitchen cabinets in a “forest green” hue after seeing a photograph of something similar. She also noted that she was looking to create a space that was vastly different from her former kitchen.</p><p>“I had a white, just, like, simple stale kitchen in my last house, which are very beautiful, but I kind of wanted to warm it up and I thought it went so well with this house,” she said.</p><p>The <a href=#>California native’s kitchen</a> is accented with gold faucets, which help maintain the “farmy-ish vibe” of the room.</p><p>As far as high-tech perks go, Jenner is particularly fond of her pot filler, which is a pipe that’s built directly into the wall above her stove that allows her to fill a pot of water without walking to a nearby sink. “I use this every day!” she said with a laugh, acknowledging that she almost declined to include the convenient gizmo in her home. “I use it every day because I’m a tea addict,” she added. “It’s perfect.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Moon Oral Care founder said of her home as a whole: “I’m really proud of what we accomplished here. This is the first home I’ve done completely, and I think it’s a genuine reflection of who I am and what I like. In the end, I’m still a young female in L.A., just trying to have some fun.”</p><p>Scroll down to see more photos of Jenner’s chic California kitchen!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2S4prrDmqOlZZqau6%2Bx0Wafmqtdlnqxu9NmnaKknJq%2FbrXNZp%2Beql2gtrWvx56lZqiZmMBw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jarrett-allen-injury-update-what-happened-to-jarrett-allen.html><span>←</span><span>Jarrett Allen Injury Update, What Happened to Jarrett Allen?</span></a>
