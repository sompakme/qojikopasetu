It’s Me, Chelsea</i> launched a new talk show, Netflix’s <i>Chelsea</i>. Featuring a loose talk-show format and guests like <b>Gwyneth Paltrow</b>, <b>Megan Fox</b>, and the U.S. Secretary of Education, new episodes of <i>Chelsea</i> are released every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday on Netflix.</p><p>Although we already know so much, Handler, 41, shared 25 interesting and unknown things about herself with <i>Us Weekly</i>.</p><p>1. My first time getting intoxicated was at my sister’s wedding. I was 16 and had four Long Island iced teas. My dad sent me to my room.</p><p>2. I can’t drink anything that’s room temperature. I like everything freezing cold.</p><p>3. My favorite body part is my stomach. I work hard on keeping it lean.</p><p>4. If I could be any person, I’d be <b>Adele</b>.</p><p>5. My ideal date is having a drink in the afternoon and having it unexpectedly lead to a fun dinner.</p><p>6. The only thing I can cook is scrambled eggs. I throw in cheese or peppers or ham.</p><p>7. I’ve bailed on hookups at the last minute based on a guy’s personality or body or small penis or weird walk.</p><p>8. I consume about 15 Jolly Ranchers a day. Unlike Gummi bears, they skipped the f–king orange flavor.</p><p>9. All my cars are chocolate brown. 50 Cent got me on that. I bought a Havana Chocolate Bentley when we dated.</p><p>10. In high school, I was very judge-y: “Don’t do drugs, they’re bad.” Then I took a hit and was like, “I love pot.”</p><p>11. I have an infrared sauna at home that I use for 30 minutes every day.</p><p>12. I was a waitress for a long time. I think everyone should wait tables for six months of their lives to learn how to treat people and servers.</p><p>13. I have adult-size bunk beds in my house. I got them for my nieces and nephews, but I sleep there all the time.</p><p>14. I’m learning Spanish.</p><p>15. Spain is my favorite country. Everything’s sexy, everyone’s laid back and I’ve never had a bad meal there.</p><p>16. Nothing gets me more excited than a 12-hour flight. I’ll just take a Xanax. I love to read and sleep.</p><p>17. Most of what’s in my closet is shoes: Alaïa, Tom Ford, Manolos.</p><p>18. <i>Terms of Endearment</i> makes me cry every time.</p><p>19. I don’t like water, so I have to put tons of lemon and cucumber in it.</p><p>20. The grossest thing I’ve ever had to do is change a diaper.</p><p>21. I love chicken nuggets.</p><p>22. I sleep in a bra every night. I just like my boobs together, not flying around.</p><p>23. I always have to have my nails done. I am grossed out when they get too long.</p><p>24. I’m messy, so I have a lot of help. If [my rescue dog] Chunk peed in the house, I won’t be cleaning it up.</p><p>25. I am not <b>Elizabeth Banks</b>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJWhwKatjKGYp5ycmr9ufpRmq6GhnpzAbsXOrmSdp56peqy6zrBkmpqfqsFuucRmrmtpYGmEeXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alyssa-milano-told-this-couple-on-the-set-of-tempting-fate-to-get-a-room.html><span>←</span><span>Alyssa Milano Told This Couple On The Set Of 'Tempting Fate' To &amp;quot;Get A Room&amp;quot;</span></a>
