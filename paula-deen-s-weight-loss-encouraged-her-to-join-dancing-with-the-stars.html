But when I finally dropped the weight off I thought, ‘Well, maybe I can do it,'” Deen, 68, said. “Maybe I can do it now. And I’ve been eating out of my new cookbook that comes out next week.”</p><p>The Food Network star dropped 35 pounds back in March after being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Despite the accomplishment, she still won’t give up one item in her diet.</p><p>“I never gave up butter. Never, never,” she said. “But the big word in my life now is ‘moderation.’ Moderation, moderation, moderation.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Also, practice, practice, practice. Deen — who is teamed up with pro dancer <strong>Louis van Amstel</strong> this season — will have to work hard for a chance at the mirrorball, but has some other ideas about how to curry favor with the judges, too. “I dunno, bring ‘em butter!” she quipped. “I’ve asked wherever they put me to stay, if there was just a little kitchen, not much of one, but that’s where I go to decompress and to get into my little safety area.”</p><p>She added: “Louis is my partner and I fed him pretty good this last week because we’ve been practicing at my house, so I fed him pretty good this week.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGapmaWhrm6wxJ6lrGWnmraotNNmo6iro2Kyr6%2FOrqman5WZeqmx0WarqGWapLavecOapZyhnpx6uLXToWStoJViwLWt0axka2hhaoB6ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lindsay-lohan-visited-annie-s-parent-trap-home-in-london.html><span>←</span><span>Lindsay Lohan Visited Annies Parent Trap Home in London</span></a>
