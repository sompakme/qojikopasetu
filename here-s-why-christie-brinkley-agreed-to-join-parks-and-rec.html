There apparently wasn't an audition to go through or any other 'test' before Brinkley was brought on board.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Ben Schwartz After 'Parks And Rec'?</a></span></p><p>In fact, the crew was apparently so shocked to even get the chance at nabbing Christie for the show that they didn't believe they really had her signed on at first. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The casting directors wanted "a Christie Brinkley type,"</a> they admitted, but no one thought&nbsp;the Christie would be willing to portray Jerry's wife.</p><p>They were shocked when she signed on, but they were also thrilled.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=so-why-did-christie-brinkley-agree-to-appear-on-the-show>So Why Did Christie Brinkley Agree To Appear On The Show?</h2><p>Ultimately, it may not have been Brinkley's dream gig to play the gorgeous wife of the often-underestimated Jerry. But as it turns out, one person was dead-set on Christie becoming the TV wife the cast dreamed of: her daughter.</p><p>Christie's daughter Sailor "was a huge fan," per&nbsp;Howard Stern, and she always appeared on set with her mom when it was Brinkley's time to shoot.</p><p>In fact, Sailor "urged" her mom to say yes to the opportunity. So while it might not have earned her megabucks in comparison to other gigs, Christie likely agreed to the role to charm <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her daughter, who also happens to be a model</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then again, Brinkley has appeared on other sitcoms, too, so maybe this is a part-time hobby for the model and entrepreneur.&nbsp;Or maybe she just gets a kick out of her kids enjoying seeing her on shows like 'The Goldbergs.'</p><h2 id=what-is-christie-brinkley-doing-now>What Is Christie Brinkley Doing Now?</h2><p>Now that 'Parks and Recreation' has&nbsp;long since ended, does Christie have any other plans to appear on TV shows? Though she had a guest role on 'The Goldbergs' most recently, Christie doesn't seem too keen to appear on TV again; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her most recent role before that</a> was on 'Nightcap' in 2017.</p><p>Of course, she's stayed plenty busy, launching a Prosecco brand and lounging on the beach on holiday. In fact, her Instagram followers are constantly asking Christie where she is and how she's found such gorgeous beaches to sunbathe on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, her time as Gayle Gergich is closer to real-life than fans thought!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Lesser-Known Facts About Former Model, Christie Brinkley</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecKhqaKrpJ6ybq7RoqWkpJWuequ7yKdkqZmioMBurc2dZKudk2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-everything-we-know-about-kylie-jenner-s-secret-california-mega-mansion.html><span>←</span><span>Here's Everything We Know About Kylie Jenner's Secret California Mega Mansion</span></a>
