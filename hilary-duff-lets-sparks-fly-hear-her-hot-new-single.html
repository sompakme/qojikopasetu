The Lizzie McGuire actress, 27, returned to the airwaves on Monday, April 6, with a hot new single.</p><p>Duff debuted "Sparks" as her first new song of 2015, after taking a bit of a break from her upcoming fifth studio album. The "Why Not" singer first introduced the project in July 2014 with the release of the single "Chasing the Sun," but <a href=#>paused the album</a> after releasing the second single "All About You" in August.</p><p>The former child star is back at it with "Sparks," which has been featured in promos for her new TV Land show Younger with <strong>Sutton Foster</strong> and <strong>Debi Mazar</strong>. The clubby track opens with a whistled melody before Duff joins in, singing, "I can't hear a single word / Just know you're talking ‘cause your lips keep moving / Every thing I thought I'd learned / Goes out the window / All I want is one thing."</p><p>The steamy lyrics are a change of tone for Duff, <a href=#>who split from her husband</a> <strong>Mike Comrie</strong> in 2014 after nearly four years together. The couple welcomed son<strong> Luca</strong>, 3, together in March 2012.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Duff is expected to release her new album&nbsp;in the coming months. Originally slated for an October 2014 debut, the record will be the singer's first in more than eight years. Her last project Dignity hit stores in April 2007.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm almost finished recording," <a href=#>she told Time last month</a>. "My record is pretty much done, and I’m just waiting. It’s tough. I put some music out last year, and right when I put my single out, we started filming the show. So it was a little bad timing because I really didn’t get a chance to properly promote my single after being out of the music game for seven years. But it was good. I feel like I got a little taste of it again and it got me excited."</p><p>Take a listen to Duff's "Sparks" in the video above!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahoZyWv7p5w66dn2WcmsG0edKpmKujo2KzrcWMoZyaql2dsrN5x6irZqaVrHq0tc2go55lYmV%2BdoKTaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dutch-influence-documentary-stars-ti%C3%ABsto-afrojack-armin-van-buuren-nicky-romero.html><span>←</span><span>Dutch Influence Documentary Stars Tisto, Afrojack, Armin van Buuren, Nicky Romero</span></a>
