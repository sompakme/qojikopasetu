Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job is well known as an American television show or series that was aired on A&E. the main focus of the series is a couple known as Brandi Passante and Jarrod Schulz. The couple works together in buying storage units, and this exactly what they showcase on the show.</p><p>The series has two members as the main casts, and they are Brandi Passante and Jarrod Schulz. The show was initially aired on the 22nd of April in 2014 that is more than five years ago. This was, however, a preview episode just to test the waters and see how well the series would be accepted by the viewers.</p><p>The series received great support from the viewers, and hence, the full series was later released on 12th August 2014. However, it lasted for approximately one and a half months as the last episode was aired on 30th September the same year. The total number of episodes aired during that duration was eight.</p><p>Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job fall under the reality show genre, and its country of origin is the United States. The show managed to air only one season that had a total of 8 episodes. Each episode was running between 21 to 22 minutes, and the executive producer was Thomas Beers and worked with a team of around seven people. The company that was honored to produce this series was Original Productions, and we can say that it did a good job. The picture format used was HDTV (1080i), which means they were clear and well done.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=evolution></span>Evolution<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The episodes had different themes as the couple did the best they could to come up with unique themes to ensure their views enjoyed the whole show. The first episode had a theme where Jarrod’s son needed a desk to use in doing his homework. Hence, Jarrod had to create a perfect solution to this problem. The first thing they had their hands on was a “Bar-Desk.” In the same episode, the homeowners association gets a treat from Jarrod after he decides to celebrate his birthday by throwing a driveway pool party.</p><p>The second season features Brandi trying out personal training. On the other hand, Jarrod is seen working hard towards coming up with the best way of proposing to his love Brandi. The best way of dealing with this without Brandi suspecting it is by turning to the least expected member of the family, and that is what he does.</p><p>The two, however, have secret deals going on. As Jarrod is planning an engagement party for his love, Brandi is on the other side planning how to sell her Jarrod’s pickup as the only way of helping pay for the forthcoming nuptials. The third season saw the couple fight when Jarrod forces them to give up some stuff to create room for him to realize his lifelong dream of a bar in his house. The kids are upset with the idea, and hence, Brandi decides to fight for them.</p><p>The whole thing seems to revolve around their wedding plans, as that is what is evident even in the 4th episode. The two, however, took some break, and although they are still planning about the wedding in the 5th and 6th season, it is not their main focus. However, come to the 7th and 8th seasons, they focus so much on planning their wedding that they have nothing else they are talking about.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=awards-and-achievements></span>Awards and achievements<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brandi and Jarrod gave Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job their best shot, and they were able to attract the attention of many fans. This is the reason why they were able to go through the 1st to the 8th episodes successfully. However, after the first season, they didn’t continue with the show, and hence, they didn’t remain in the media long enough to attract awards and nominations.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=net-worth-of-brandi-and-jarrod></span>Net worth of Brandi and Jarrod<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After the end of the 1st season of Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job, the couple didn’t continue with the show. However, this was not the end of their appearance on the TV. They started another show which they titled Storage Wars, and again, they were the star. This has increased their net worth, and at the moment, their net worth is estimated at $5 million as of January 2021 and is expected to rise even higher with time.</p><p>Many couples have planned their weddings and kept it to themselves. However, Brandi and Jarrod decided to share it with the whole world, and this is what led to the invention of Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job, which was well received by their viewers. Although there are rumors that the two have split, there is no confirmation of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqilrultYyjmKuqn5l6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ariana-grande-dated-multiple-men-fresh-out-of-long-term-relationships-here-s-why.html><span>←</span><span>Ariana Grande Dated Multiple Men Fresh Out Of Long Term Relationships, Here's Why</span></a>
