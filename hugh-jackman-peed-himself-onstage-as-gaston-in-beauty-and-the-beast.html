I was playing Gaston," Jackman, 42, tells <strong>Rachael Ray</strong> in an interview airing Friday. "Gaston has red tights, knee high boots, and it's very physical. I had headaches everyday for two months. I went to an astropath [psychic] and he said 'Well, you're dehydrated.' So of course [following his advice] I had four liters of water," says Jackman of his 1996 theater days in Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>"I go down to the stage, getting ready for my first number…and I'm like I really need to go again. [The routine is] the most cardiovascular song I've ever done: literally I'm picking up Belle and as I pick her up, I stopped singing and right in that moment I realized the muscles you need to release in order to sing are the ones you do not want to release if you need to go," the actor tells Ray.</p><p>Urinating on stage in front of the audience, Jackman says he had to forgo the number in order to relieve himself.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'm carrying her [over one shoulder] not singing, and she's going 'What's going on? What's going on?' So finally, it's embarrassing at this point," he tells Ray. "I've not sung an entire verse."</p><p>Hugh Jackman's interview on The Rachael Ray Show airs Friday (check local listings).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ%2Bun5hit6KvyqaYp2WgmrKleceipKydnJt6sLrSrZignV2WwG6zwKyrqKZdnrtursSarK2xXZ67bsDHnmSbnZGowW5%2Bj2poamphZXw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./don-omar-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Don Omar Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
