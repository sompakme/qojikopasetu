Ye has reportedly been experiencing financial difficulties the last year, ever since losing his billionaire status in 2023 following antisemitic behavior, which cost him his Adidas x Yeezy collab.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The rapper is facing millions in lawsuits (including a $250 million defamation case filed by George Floyd’s family), and has been selling off various properties, with some assuming it’s necessary in order to liquidate his assets. There was even a report from earlier this month that Kanye is growing concerned with Bianca’s spending habits.</p><p>While the titanium dentures are reportedly permanent, Kanye may not be able to keep them in for the long-term, as reports suggest his oral health could seriously suffer.</p><p>“Microscopically, there will be a lot of food, bacteria and debris getting underneath the titanium which can then cause a lot of bad breath, sensitivity, tooth decay and gum issues such as disease and infection if the titanium is there long term,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian dentist Dr Sam Koh told Daily Mail.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The remaining part of the teeth will move over time, causing deterioration of the glue that is holding the titanium in place,” he continued. "This would then result in either the bridge coming loose over time, or much worse, dental decay, infection and disease with the bacteria able to then get inside the teeth."</p><p>Despite Kanye’s outspoken nature, the rapper hasn’t commented on the controversy surrounding his new smile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm6GRo7CiecKepaynop56pbHFnqWdq12grq%2FFxKxkcW1gZX1xecOepa2toprAbrDErKeirJViurC6xLJkoqujqrK0ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./antoni-porowski-victor-cruz-nev-schulman-pose-in-hanes-campaign.html><span>←</span><span>Antoni Porowski, Victor Cruz, Nev Schulman Pose in Hanes Campaign</span></a>
