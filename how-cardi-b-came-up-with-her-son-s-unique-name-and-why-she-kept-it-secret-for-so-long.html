But the rapper left fans a little confused when she didn’t reveal his name immediately. Rather than telling fans her baby’s name and sharing his picture, as she did with her first baby, Kulture, she kept those details from the public.</p><p>Cardi has since confirmed that she and Offset had a good reason for keeping their son out of the spotlight and not revealing his name for seven months after his birth.</p><h2 id=what-is-cardi-b-rsquo-s-son-rsquo-s-name>What Is Cardi B’s Son’s Name?</h2><p>From the moment Cardi B and Offset’s second child was born in September 2021, fans were dying to know his name. The couple announced the name of their first child, Kulture Kiari Cephus, immediately after she was born, and Cardi made a habit of gushing about her on social media and sharing photos of her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Since the day she came out, she was so gorgeous,” Cardi said in a 2022 interview with Essence about Kulture. “She’s like a breath of fresh air.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Say Cardi B & Britney Spears Have This In Common</a></span></p><p>So it came as a slight surprise when Cardi and Offset chose to keep their son’s name to themselves.</p><p>According to Just Jared, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their son’s name is Wave Set Cephus.</a></p><p>Originally, the couple was thinking of the name Marley as a middle name. Marley comes from Cardi’s own middle name, which is Marlenis. But it’s been reported that Cardi didn’t like Wave Marley Cephus.</p><h2 id=what-was-the-inspiration-behind-the-name>What Was The Inspiration Behind The Name?</h2><p>Sources claim that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Offset came up with the name Wave</a>. When he suggested it to Cardi, she loved it immediately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Set comes from Offset’s name, as his friends reportedly call him Set. His real name is Kiari Kendrell Cephus.</p><p>Offset was also the inspiration behind Kulture’s name, as her middle name and last name are directly taken from him. The rapper also reportedly chose Kulture’s first name due to its relation to his group Migos, who have an album called Culture and another album called Culture II.</p><h2 id=why-did-cardi-b-wait-to-reveal-his-name>Why Did Cardi B Wait To Reveal His Name?</h2><p>Cardi B and Offset waited seven months before publicly revealing Wave’s name. They also held off from sharing images of his face on social media or selling photos to the press.</p><p>They first revealed his name and photo at the same time in a post published on the couple’s Instagram pages.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Cardi’s Instagram, she shared an image of Wave in a blue fur-trimmed coat and blue beanie wearing a diamond-encrusted pendant that displayed his name. The photo on Offset’s Instagram showed Wave in the bath wearing a diamond necklace. He captioned it WAVE SET CEPHUS.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Interesting Meanings Behind Cardi B's Tattoos</a></span></p><p>The couple also starred in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photoshoot for </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essence</a> with their two children and Offset’s three children from outside their relationship. They gave an interview to accompany the photoshoot, in which Cardi explained that they decided to keep their son’s identity private to avoid internet trolls.</p><p>In the interview, Cardi specified that the family had received a lot of hate and online attacks when they announced Kulture’s name and shared photos of her publicly. So they wanted to keep Wave’s idenitity just to them for as long as it made sense, and avoid giving the trolls anything to talk about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We went through a lot of sad things when it comes to Kulture—terrible behavior that not even the older kids have ever been through,” Cardi told Essence, speaking about Offset’s three other children.</p><p>“So many people will post mean, disgusting things, just to get a reaction from us,” she went on, adding, “we get very, very angry and upset."</p><p>In the interview, Cardi also opened up about her relationship with Offset’s children, revealing that she loves them like she loves her birth children: “I feel like sometimes people go into a relationship with a man or a woman who has kids with negativity—and I feel like people should embrace it, and love it. I love our family, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Cardi B Has An Adorable History Of Fangirling Over Film Stars</a></span></p><p>As for how Cardi B and Offset are raising their children, both parents have made it clear that they want to <a href=#>teach the kids to appreciate what they have and understand that nothing comes for free.</a></p><p>“We still teach our kids like normal parents,” Offset said in the Essence interview. “I’ve never told my daughter she’s a celebrity. I want her to have the mind of a working person. I always tell my kids how hard I worked, how many years I put in to be in a position where everything is good.”</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Does Cardi B Call Offset By His Real Name Or His Rap Name?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIycmKucmWKvbrrAppxmoJWnerS7zWaqnpuimsFw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./former-nba-player-jj-redick-selling-brooklyn-penthouse-for-8-5-million.html><span>←</span><span>Former NBA Player, JJ Redick, Selling Brooklyn Penthouse For $8.5 Million</span></a>
