The contestants vie for true love while competing in both team and couples’ challenges.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/%E2%80%98Love-Island-Games-Gets-%E2%80%98Really-Awkward-After-New-Bombshells-Arrive-1st-Look2.jpg><p>Earlier this month, host <a href=#><strong>Maya Jama</strong></a> told <a href=# rel=noopener>Elite Daily</a> how the new show format has raised the stakes. “The challenge element is taken very seriously,” she said. “There’s a lot of sneaky behavior from islanders. A lot of tactical, nonloyal maneuvers.”</p><p>Jama, 29, added that she thinks the “most surprising” aspect of Love Island Games is how difficult the challenges are.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Going into it, I was assuming that they’d be Love Island-esque games: not too tough, lighthearted, a lot of kissing,” she said. “But there are some really hard ones where you have to use your full strength. I couldn’t do a lot of them. I would be wiped out straight away. Considering the islanders are not gladiators or athletes, they did incredible.”</p><p>New episodes of Love Island Games premiere on Peacock at 9 p.m. ET six nights a week, Sunday through Friday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrS4wKebZp%2BRorK0ecaeq6xlkay4uK3RnWSanqSav26uzqaZrKCVobm0ecCrqaKulWJ%2BtMCMpaaoo18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./here-s-why-fans-think-superstore-is-so-similar-to-the-office.html><span>←</span><span>Heres Why Fans Think Superstore Is So Similar To The Office</span></a>
