The show first came about back in 2005 and introduced some of the most iconic characters from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Scott</a>, Dwight Schrute, and Stanley Hudson, to name a few.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the show is no longer on air, fans continue to enjoy all nine seasons of hilarity, which has since become available on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Netflix</strong></a>. Luckily, similar shows such as Parks & Rec and Brooklyn Nine-Nine have since come out, however, it is NBC's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superstore</a> that has fans making the most comparisons!</p><p>The show first aired in 2015 and stars America Ferrera, Ben Feldman, and Nico Santos. While it has clearly made a name for itself, viewers have caught on to an array of similarities between&nbsp;that&nbsp;and The Office, and it all comes down to its characters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>5 Couples From 'The Office' That Should Have Never Happened</a></span></p><h2 id=superstore-meets-the-office>'Superstore' Meets 'The Office'</h2><p>When Superstore first aired back in 2015, fans could not get enough of the non-stop hilarity that takes place at Cloud 9, a fictional department store meant to compete with Target and Walmart!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series has been on air now for 6 seasons, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this is the final season</a> after the show lead, America Ferrera announced she'd be stepping down from her role as Amy Sosa. &nbsp;Despite its end, fans can continue to enjoy the non-stop comedy on Netflix, as the series fits five seasons is ready to be binged.</p><p>As more and more fans tune into Superstore, the more they make comparisons to the hit series, The Office. The biggest similarity between the two shows comes from their characters, which viewers instantly linked between the NBC shows.</p><p>For starters, fans immediately noticed how Dina Fox, the assistant manager at Cloud 9, is very similar to the assistant to the assistant manager at Dunder Mifflin, Dwight Schrute. The two are both tell-it-like-it-is types, who aren't afraid to take the lead and do it with an added bonus of sass and politically incorrectness.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>'The Office': 10 Episodes That Pulled At The Heartstrings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if that wasn't convincing enough, Cloud 9 manager, Glenn Sturgis, and Dunder Mifflin's boss, Michael Scott are easily the same person! Not only do they hold old-school values, but the two characters are sometimes offensive without even knowing it.</p><p>As for company couples, Jim and Pam reign as one of the best on-screen couples, and rightfully so! Well, it appears as if Superstore would be incomplete without its very own Jim and Pam. In this case, Amy and Jonah easily take the cake. The two began as the "will they won't they?" couple, who obviously end up together in what turns into a happily ever after story, just like Amy and Jonah!</p><p>Fans continue to claim that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Superstore is the successor to&nbsp;The Office</a>, and it doesn't stop there! Mindy Kaling's character, Kelly Kapoor is most similar to Cheyenne due to their bubbly and dazed personalities, all while fan-favorite Garrett is most like Stanley Hudson, mainly for their mutual hatred for their jobs and disinterest in most of their co-worker's lives!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Did Steve Carell Watch The Original ‘The Office’?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmnZqmo2LBqbXNpGSsraCav7TAzqucZqGjYsCwedKipKKkkad6tbuMrZ%2BeZZ%2Bbs6qvxGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./did-rihanna-lip-sync-at-the-super-bowl-howard-stern-calls-out-singer-over-divisive-performance.html><span>←</span><span>Did Rihanna lip sync at the Super Bowl?
