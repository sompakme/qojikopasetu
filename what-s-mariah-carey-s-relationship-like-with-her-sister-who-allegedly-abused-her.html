Both <a href=#>Morgan and Alison filed a lawsuit</a> against the Hero hitmaker over the "unnecessary public humiliation" caused by the tell-all.</p><p>Alison also accused their mom of sexual abuse at "satanic worship meetings."

When <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> asked the <a href=#>self-proclaimed diva</a> why her siblings were "extremely violent," she said that they were just "damaged."</p><p>"We don't even really know each other, and that's the thing," she explained. "We didn't grow up together, but we did. Like, they were on their journeys, by the time I got into the world, they had already been damaged, in my opinion. But again, I wasn't there. I was dropped into this world and I literally felt like an outsider amongst my own family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mariah also told the host that Alison and Morgan have always thought that [her] life was easy" and "also always looked for ... a get rich quick scheme." She added: "[My siblings] just grew up with the experience of living with a Black father and a white mother together, as a family, and I was, for the most part, living with my mother, which they saw as easier, but in reality it was not."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Mariah Carey And Rosie O'Donnell?</a></span></p><h2 id=does-mariah-carey-have-a-relationship-with-her-sister-now>Does Mariah Carey Have A Relationship With Her Sister Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52145137-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn't seem like Mariah and Alison have patched things up in the last few years. In 2021, the latter was reportedly homeless and was seeking assistance in acquiring Social Security benefits. After a series of unfortunate health issues, Carey said in an interview that she had "no clue" she was in a "medical facility" for four months. She suffers from short-term memory loss.</p><p>"It doesn't surprise me, because these type of places don't get back to you, they don't respond," she said at that time. According to his friend, David Baker — who had set up a GoFundMe page to fund her new dentures — Alison was hit in her head with a baseball bat when her home was robbed on Long Island in 2015. The man "left her for dead" After stealing her jewelry.</p><p>She had already been homeless for over a year by the time she was hospitalized. She couldn't remember anything, "but I wouldn't be surprised," said Alison. During the time of the interview, David was already helping her out, giving her $700 to stay in her apartment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked about it, Alison said: "I don't know how he's been doing it ... he's been doing everything he can to help me, I really appreciate that." Most fans sided with Mariah, saying that they understand why she cut off ties with her sister based on what they've read in her memoir.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Happened Between Mariah Carey And Howard Stern?</a></span></p><h2 id=where-is-mariah-carey-39-s-mother-now>Where Is Mariah Carey's Mother Now?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ee_ijo9xgae0_oj.jpeg><p>When Alison sued Mariah over defamation, court documents stated that the former had been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and depression after "the horrific abuse" she suffered at the "terrifying middle-of-the-night satanic worship meetings" she said her mother, Patricia had forced her to attend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added that her famous sister used her "status as a public figure to attack her penniless sister" and that she fabricated "sensational" headlines about Alison to promote her book. Unlike Morgan and Alison, Patricia seems to have a relationship with Mariah.</p><p>In 2021, amid the lawsuit, the five-time Grammy winner sold her mom's upstate New York home for $757,444 — more than $250,000 the asking price. She bought it for her in 1994. Mariah had apparently relocated the former opera singer and vocal coach to a "five-star luxury resort for seniors" in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>"She's moving to a nice five-star assisted living residence, where nurses will wait on her hand and foot, but it's still a million miles from anyone," a source told The Sun at that time. Patricia never spoke about her children's public feud, but she notably had a falling out with Mariah in 2001 when the latter had a <a href=#>nervous breakdown while promoting her box-office flop, Glitter</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The whole cop thing was just Pat’s jealous, mean-spirited nature," the insider said of that time. "Mariah was at no time a danger to herself or anyone else. Patricia wanted the world to know her vulnerable daughter was breaking down, she enjoyed Mariah being brought down a peg or three. I would have never forgiven her, it was a nasty, vindictive thing to do."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkqHqurdGimKFlk5a%2FpsXSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWcnrimedaiq6FlmJq%2Fbr%2FIrKueql2stbB51pqqZpmSqsCqwsRmq6hlmJq%2FbrPRqK6ippdiwrF7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./top-quotes-from-drum-n-bass-pioneer-goldie.html><span>←</span><span>Top Quotes from Drum n Bass Pioneer Goldie</span></a>
