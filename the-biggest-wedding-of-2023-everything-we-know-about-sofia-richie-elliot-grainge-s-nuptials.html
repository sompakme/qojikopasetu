Given that they both come from wealth, it’s no surprise the couple went all-out for their nuptials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sofia is the daughter of music legend Lionel Richie, <a href=#>who has a reported net worth of $200 million</a>. While Elliot is a non-celebrity, he followed in his father’s footsteps of becoming a music executive. His dad, Lucian Grange, is the Chief Executive Officer of Universal Music Group. In fact, Lionel and Lucien have collaborated on music many times over the years, which is how Elliot and Sofia were introduced.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian Criticized For Spending Fortune On Birthday Flowers</a></span></p><p>The newlyweds haven’t been shy to share photos and videos on social media of their wedding celebrations, with Sofia even giving an exclusive interview to Vogue about her outfit choices. Here’s everything we know about Elliot and Sofia’s wedding.</p><h2 id=elliot-amp-sofia-reportedly-spent-1-5-million-on-the-venue>Elliot & Sofia Reportedly Spent $1.5 Million on The Venue</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There were many luxurious elements to Elliot and Sofia’s wedding, but the location may have been the priciest. The couple chose to tie the knot in Antibes, France at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc.</p><p>According to New York Post, it’s plausible that the <a href=#>pair spent $1.5 million to rent out the venue</a> for the weekend. The least inexpensive room rents for $2,300 per night, while a junior suite is $3,750. The most expensive accommodation the hotel offers is its villa, which is $32,000 per night. The hotel has 40 rooms, 68 suites and 3 villas, so if Elliot and Sofia rented the entire venue for their wedding, a million-dollar price tag is likely.</p><p>Luckily, the hotel featured a variety of amenities guests were free to enjoy over the wedding weekend, such as 24-hour, in-room dining as well as complimentary electric buggies and bikes. The hotel also has 6 lounges and bars plus 3 restaurants, including the Michelin-star Louroc Restaurant. Additionally, there’s a pool, private cabanas, tennis courts, and yoga spaces.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moreover, the hotel will arrange a small yacht for guests to visit neighbouring places, like Cannes, Saint Tropez, and Monaco.</p><h2 id=the-wedding-featured-a-lot-of-entertainment>The Wedding Featured A Lot Of Entertainment</h2><p>Elliot and Sofia made sure their guests were well entertained during the actual wedding, and they likely spent a pretty dime on performers. Stephen Sanchez performed live at the altar, including when Sofia walked down the aisle.</p><p>Sanchez later played at the reception. There were also performances by Good Charlotte, Joel Madden’s band. Joel is married to Nicole Richie, Sofia’s sister, who emceed for the evening. Sofia’s father Lionel Richie also performed to no surprise, including during the couple’s first dance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>Morgan Wallen Sued By Fan After Cancelling Concert Due To Sickness</a></span></p><p>The couple ended the wedding celebrations with a private fireworks performance. The average <a href=#>fireworks display costs between $1,000 to $2,000</a> per minute, so they’re often $20,000 or more. Needless to say, it likely wasn’t a cheap choice for Elliot and Sofia.</p><h2 id=sofia-wore-multiple-custom-chanel-outfits>Sofia Wore Multiple Custom Chanel Outfits</h2><p>Sofia chose to work with iconic <a href=#>fashion house Chanel to create multiple wedding outfits</a>. It’s not known how much the model spent on the looks. She may have not even had to pay if it was considered a promotional collaboration. But custom designer dresses can easily cost tens of thousands, so Sofia’s looks were definitely pricey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the Saturday ceremony, Sofia walked down the aisle in a sleek Chanel dress with a high neckline and featuring iridescent beading.</p><p>The model <a href=#>opened up to Vogue about the process</a> of working with vogue to create the main dress. “We created the top of that dress and made it bridal-y,” she explained. “It is such magic. I honestly think Elliot is going to love it. He is my biggest cheerleader when it comes to anything I wear,” Sofia continued. “If he doesn’t cry, I’ll be very sad.”</p><p>She later slipped into a shorter Chanel dress featuring a white camelia flower on the front. Sofia explained she wanted to be comfortable for the wedding reception.</p><p>“I can dance, [and] I can move,” she told Vogue. “I love it! It’s traditional Chanel. I will be eating pizza and fries in this dress. Pray for this dress. It will be my life’s mission to make sure nothing happens to it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sofia also wore a custom Chanel look for the rehearsal diner, which was held on Friday.</p><h2 id=sofia-s-engagement-amp-wedding-rings-cost-nearly-1-million>Sofia’s Engagement & Wedding Rings Cost Nearly $1 Million</h2><p>Now that she’s a married woman, Sofia is sporting some serious bling on her left hand. The model has already been photographed sporting her new wedding band, opting for a thick yet sleek silver band. She wore it next to the 6-carat emerald engagement ring Elliot proposed with last April.</p><p>It's unclear how much Sofia’s wedding band costs, but her engagement ring is <a href=#>reportedly valued at $800,000.</a> So, it’s likely that the entire set of rings costs a cool million dollars.</p><p>From the wedding to the outfits, Elliot and Sofia’s wedding was a luxurious event, so there’s no doubt that the overall price tag was high.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>Ben Affleck & Matt Damon Were Broke Together After ‘Good Will Hunting’</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Vogue</a>, <a href=#>NY Post</a>, <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMm6Cgn5WowW7DxJ2boqaXYryneZFpaWxllauys8XToaCnn12ssm63zaiuZpmSpMK1edKonaKZXae2pLTInmSepJyevLV5xquYoqaXmsBuutSpq6KZnKh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-clarkson-opens-up-about-brandon-blackstock-divorce.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Clarkson Opens Up About Brandon Blackstock Divorce</span></a>
