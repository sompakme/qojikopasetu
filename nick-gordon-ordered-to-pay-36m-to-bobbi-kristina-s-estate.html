Jackson Bedford found Gordon liable for the death of the daughter of <a href=# id=auto-tag_bobby-brown data-tag=bobby-brown>Bobby Brown</a> the late Whitney Houston, <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a> states. Gordon, who was in a relationship with Kristina at the time of her passing&nbsp;was blamed by Brown the other members of her family in the wrongful death suit.</p><p>In January 2015, Kristina was found unresponsive face down in a bathtub at her Atlanta home. The family testified that Brown was given a “toxic cocktail” before her unconscious&nbsp;state. Kristina died in hospice case at the age of 22 in July 2015. Autopsy reports didn’t give a clear cause of death, but&nbsp;morphine, cocaine, alcohol and prescription drugs were found in her system.&nbsp;In total, Gordon was ordered to fork over $36,250,000.</p><p>“There was an urgent need, in my mind, to get justice for Bobbi Kristina Brown and that’s why I took the case,” Attorney David Ware said in a statement. “We intend to pursue, with all vigor, the full collection of the judgment. We hope that in some small way this will allow Krissy’s family to continue their quest for peace.”</p><p>“Domestic violence is a horrible reality in our society, and Bobbi suffered such horrific pain and degradation at the hands of Nick Gordon, the man she loved and trusted,” Attorney Glenda Hatchett added. “No one should suffer the way she did and the judge sent a strong message in the award of punitive damages that this despicable behavior is inexcusable and will not be tolerated.”</p><p>Family members claimed Gordon was violent to Kristina. The plaintiffs&nbsp;in the case originally demanded $50 million for&nbsp;assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress and “transferring money from Brown’s account into his own without authorization as causes.” The judge came up with the final verdict after Gordon was a no-show in court twice and looked at Kristina’s future potential earnings and her net worth before her death.</p><p>“To determine the value of a life is pretty difficult. So the court has been back there primarily struggling with that particular issue,” Bedford said.</p><p>The breakdown includes:</p><ul><li>$1.575 million for money taken from the account, including alleged stolen rings</li><li>$250,000 in punitive damages</li><li>$1.37 million for assault and battery</li><li>$13.8 million for pain and suffering as a result of assault</li><li>$4.2 million in punitive damages</li><li>$15 million for present value of life</li></ul><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>USA Today</a> reports emotions were high during the long case. Kristina’s half-sister La’Princia Brown along with her father gave tearful testimonials about Kristina’s time in hospice care. “I played music to her a lot. I could see her eyes looking around the room. She would cough. She would yawn. It didn’t seem right that she couldn’t communicate. She’d blink and more tears could come. I feel like she could see me but couldn’t say anything.”</p><p>Gordon was not present during the final verdict.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O2pLeMoKarnJ%2BjerW7jKmYsmVja7puwM5mmaiakp56rL7IrKuippGoeqa%2F05qrnmVka4R5hJNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-takes-a-fashion-risk-in-completely-sheer-pants-pics.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Takes a Fashion Risk in Completely Sheer Pants: Pics</span></a>
