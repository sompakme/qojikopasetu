It's heartbreaking to realize that while the actress made fans laugh and relate to her character's coming-of-age storylines, she was suffering behind the scenes.</p><p>Unlike some of her other Modern Family co-stars, Ariel Winter <strong>didn't act much when Modern Family ended</strong>, and fans might have trouble naming some of her biggest projects. But since she made so much money during the popular sitcom, she was totally fine. In this article, we'll take a look at how much money Ariel Winter earned before and after Modern Family, along with what her career looked like after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-ariel-winter-39-s-net-worth-and-what-happened-to-her-career-after-modern-family>What Is Ariel Winter's Net Worth And What Happened To Her Career After Modern Family?</h2><p><strong>Ariel Winter has a net worth of $12 million</strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, and she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned a high annual salary on Modern Family</a>. After being paid $70,000 for every episode of the hit sitcom, she <strong>got a raise of $125,000 for each episode</strong>. As Celebrity Net Worth noted, she began <strong>earning a yearly salary of $2.75 million</strong> during the last few seasons. In 2013, <a href=#>Ariel Winter</a><strong><a href=#> signed a $6 million contract</a> </strong>for Modern Family.</p><p>The star also made money from starring in several movies during her time on Modern Family, although her salaries are unknown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/modern-family-refused-to-comment-after-rumors-surfaced-that-ariel-winter-was-going-to-fired-from-the-show-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Ariel Winter didn't play any memorable roles after Modern Family ended, she has so much money in the bank that she can be in full control of her career instead of worrying about finances. It can be hard for an actor to find a role that really speaks to them, especially when they have spent so long playing one beloved character. After Modern Family ended, Winter only starred in a handful of projects. She played Abigail Blyg in the video game The Quarry, Cole in the 2022 short film Bully, and Kai in the 2023 movie Tripped Up.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:29</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-26t113519-921.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Julie Bowen Revealed Ariel Winter Was Purposely "Covered Up" For The Sake Of Her Character On Modern Family</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Julie Bowen revealed what went on behind the scenes with Ariel Winter's wardrobe on Modern Family.</span><p>What Notable Movies Did Ariel Winter Star In During Modern Family?</p><ul><li>Opposite Day (2009)</li><li>Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs (2009)</li><li>Killers (2009)</li><li>Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Across the 2nd Dimension (2011)</li><li>ParaNorman (2012)</li><li>Mr. Peabody & Sherman (2014)</li><li>Smurfs: The Last Village (2017)</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's <strong>unclear how much money Winter earned for these projects</strong>. However, no matter what she was paid, she has the freedom to say yes to the projects that interest her because of her high net worth and Modern Family salary. Backstage reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actors have to be paid at least $65,000 for a movie</a> if they play a member of the main or supporting cast. The publication also noted that voice actors can be paid $10,000 for a main animated movie role. Since Winter voiced many characters in animated movies throughout her time on Modern Family and also starred in a few live-action films, she must have done well for herself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ariel-winter-s-battle-with-mental-health-issues-led-to-her-weight-loss-front-instar-back-deposite.jpg><p>While Ariel Winter is likely thrilled that she earned a high annual salary on Modern Family, she is focused on building a great movie career.

The film focuses on friends who attend a food festival and saw her smoking marijuana as part of the role.

However, as Entertainment Tonight reported in 2018, she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">decided to leave UCLA</a> because she <strong>wanted to star in movies</strong>.

Despite her desire to appear in more films, her resume is still pretty bare. Her 2022 short film Bully might not have paid her a lot, and she only starred in one movie in 2023. That allows her to take on the movie roles that she really wants to play without feeling like she has to act a lot to make a living. She did voice the character of D'Erika Tendi in the 2023 TV series Star Trek: Lower Decks, but her salary is unknown.</p><p>Ariel Winter's Notable TV Roles During Modern Family</p><ul><li>Sofia in Sofia The First (2013-2018)</li><li>Gracie and Jennie in The Haunting Hour: The Series (2011)</li><li>voice of several characters in Robot Chicken (2019)</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Ariel Winter's IMDb page, she had <strong>three upcoming projects as of mid-March 2024</strong>. She played Teddy in one episode of the TV series Hungry, Delaney in the movie Pools, and Annie in the movie Don't Log Off. While her salaries are unknown for these projects as well, she can likely command a fairly high salary thanks to her place in the industry.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYq6GVoXq4tc2tnKtlo5a5or7YZqWerF2svLPAx2akqK6ZmsBuwNVmqqGnp2LAqrrCnmSmp5Sav695xZqkoqSpZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anne-heche-claims-ex-ellen-degeneres-didn-t-want-her-dressing-sexy.html><span>←</span><span>Anne Heche Claims Ex Ellen DeGeneres Didn't Want Her Dressing 'Sexy'</span></a>
