Some feel very passionate about it: Joaquin Phoenix, for example, addressed our disconnection from the natural world in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oscar speech</a> and Morrissey has been vocal about animal rights ever since the eighties.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z’s 5 Closest Friends (& 5 Celebs He Stays Away From)</a></span></p><p>There are plenty of celebrities who follow a vegan and plant-based diet. Not all of them share their dietary preferences with the world, though. Since they are mostly known for what they do rather than what they eat, many fans never find out their favorite celebrities are vegans. Here is a list of ten celebrities who abstain from eating animal products.</p><h2 id=zac-efron><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Zac Efron</span></h2><p>Following a vegan diet is just one of the many <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things Zac Efron does to stay in shape</a>. He first spoke out about it two years ago, claiming it helps his sleep, metabolism, and overall well being. There's even a pre-red-carpet smoothie he shared with the world: it's made of spinach, avocado, kale, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, almond milk, chia seeds, and coconut water.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What's confusing about Zac's vegan philosophy is that last year, he posted a photo on Instagram that shows him fishing with his friend. Not very vegan of him!</p><h2 id=ellen-page><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ellen Page</span></h2><p>A quick glance at Ellen Page's Instagram instantly reveals she's a huge animal lover. Named as the sexiest vegan in 2014 by PETA, Ellen has been practicing veganism for ages.</p><p>The compassionate actor fights for equality on all fronts. She once famously said: “Why are vegans made fun of while the inhumane factory farming process regards animals and the natural world merely as commodities to be exploited for profit?”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=woody-harrelson><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Woody Harrelson</span></h2><p>Sure <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody Harrelson seems a bit sketchy sometimes</a>, but this outstanding actor has been a vegan for half of his life. He takes veganism a bit further than most: he only eats raw foods. It gives him much more energy than cooked and non-vegan meals. Also, it apparently slows down the aging process.</p><p>He has turned his co-stars vegan and wrote an appeal to the Pope to go vegan for Lent. Born and raised in Texas, he feels strongly about an event called "the Bacon Bash", where wild hogs are captured and tormented for entertainment purposes.</p><h2 id=casey-affleck><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Casey Affleck</span></h2><p>Casey Affleck has been a vegan for 15 years. Why? His reasons mostly pertain to the inhumane meat industry. He works with PETA and has made several public service announcements with the organization.</p><p>He is married to a fellow vegan, Summer Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix's sister. A few years ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she filed for divorce</a>, but the vegan duo never finalized it. They remain married to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=liam-hemsworth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Liam Hemsworth</span></h2><p>Fans are swooning over Liam Hemsworth's Instagram posts that feature him with dogs and animals, but not many know that he has also actually been a vegan since 2015.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth’s 10 Closest Celebrity Friends</a></span></p><p>His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-wife</a>, Miley Cyrus, is also a vegan, but she's always been far more vocal about it than Liam. Following the same diet might mean a lot in a marriage, but it certainly isn't enough to make it last.</p><h2 id=carrie-underwood><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Carrie Underwood</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most known as the winner of American Idol, Carry Underwood is all about living a healthy lifestyle. Her Instagram is filled with <a href=#>posts of her working out </a>and she just recently published a bestseller called Find Your Path.</p><p>Carrie Underwood follows a vegan diet but makes an exception with eggs here and there. In her defense, they come from her own chickens that she has in the backyard. Otherwise, she's a big fan of tofu and smoothies.</p><h2 id=rza><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>RZA</span></h2><p>Wu-Tang clan member RZA tries his best to lead a peaceful life, vegan diet included. His transition towards vegan diet began back in 1995 when he gave up red meat. Soon, poultry and fish followed. He simply didn't want to be responsible for the deaths of any living creatures.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RZA's exemplary lifestyle inspired his sons to be vegans as well. In 2019, he created a vegan jacket, made out of ocean plastic. He is a true environmentalist.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Meghan Markle</span></h2><p>Ever since she started being associated with the British royal family, Meghan hasn't publicly discussed her private life, her diet included. Most tabloids cared more about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">royal wedding</a> than what she eats. It's known that she has broken her veganism on several occasions, but otherwise, the Suits star is all about living an ethical lifestyle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Ways Meghan Markle Is Like Princess Diana (& 5 Big Differences)</a></span></p><p>Lately, the media has labeled her as a "flexitarian". Be that as it may, she has promoted a plant-based diet way before it was cool.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ariana Grande</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The press and fans are too obsessed with her dating life and hit songs to dive deep into <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariana Grande</a>'s dietary preferences. As <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a typical Cancer</a>, she possesses a sensitive, emotional soul and cares deeply about fellow humans as well as animals.</p><p>She has been vegan since 2013 and is now very active in the animal rights community. Her fans can see what she's eating on Snapchat, oatmeal with berries being one of the singer's favorite meals.</p><h2 id=travis-barker><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Travis Barker</span></h2><p>Blink 182's drummer became a vegan back in 2008 after surviving a plane crash. However, he has ditched meat when he was a teenager. Just like Woody Harrelson, Barker similarly reports having loads of energy since becoming a vegan. He never gets tired, despite the fact that drumming demands quite a lot of physical energy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's not the only Blink 182 member who stays away from animal products - Matt Skiba is a vegan too.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrities Who Practice Yoga And Are Looking Great</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6or7EZq2en5Gjerutwmacn6qfo3quscahmKdlnZa%2FrLjEZpiroZGjrm6z0ZqlnZ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-celebrities-rooting-for-in-2023-mlb-world-series.html><span>←</span><span>Who Are Celebrities Rooting for in 2023 MLB World Series?</span></a>
