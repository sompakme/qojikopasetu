The bout marked Cole’s first time wrestling on pay-per-view since AEW x NJPW Forbidden Door in June 2022, as he missed several months due to consecutive head injuries. Cole and Jericho have been involved in a heated rivalry for several weeks, and it reached a new level at Double or Nothing.</p><p>The two foes waged war in an Unsanctioned Match, and ECW legend Sabu served as the special guest enforcer. He wound up being an equalizer for Cole, as the Jericho Appreciation Society interfered early on, and Sabu helped fight them off. Britt Baker, Cole’s girlfriend, also got involved as she hit Jericho with a kendo stick. The match reached its controversial conclusion when Cole mounted Jericho and punched him until referee Aubrey Edwards called for the bell.</p><p>Here’s how the match broke down, courtesy of our play-by-play coverage:</p><p>Britt Baker comes down and hits Jericho with a kendo stick. Saraya gets in the ring, and Baker hits her, too. They leave, and Jericho is left alone with Cole, who chokes him with a kendo stick. Jericho throws a chair at Jericho and sends him crashing through a table. Jericho brings out a steel chain, but Cole drops him with a DDT onto a chair. Cole superkicks Jericho and hits the Panama Sunrise (destroyer). Jericho chokes Cole with the chain.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Cole rallies and kicks Jericho. He hits the Boom and ties the chain to his knee before he hits the Boom again. Cole blasts Jericho with some punches and busts him open. He keeps punching until the referee calls for the bell.</p><p>Catch up on our coverage of AEW Double or Nothing <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJwbHJsZGKupa3MZpqopJVir6at06xknKCinsButsSroJygn2LDqq2Mq5yfnaKasrR5w56aoquZpLturdNmmJ6vXZm8tq7LnmSoql2jvLW0yKee</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-actors-who-suck-at-their-job-now.html><span>←</span><span>20 Actors Who Suck At Their Job Now</span></a>
