The actor had become a very controversial figure in the <a href=#><strong>That 70s Show</strong></a> cast after being accused of hideous crimes against multiple women, and recently, he was found to be guilty and <a href=#>sentenced to 30 years in prison</a>.</p><p>As a result, the rest of the cast got caught in the whirlwind, most of them not in a good way, since they refuse to see that their former friend needs to be held accountable for his actions. Not Laura Prepon, though. This superstar will not be dragged into this mess. Instead, she's focusing on a new chapter of her career, one that seems to be very different from what fans are used to seeing her do. And judging by the response from her fans, she's doing great.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=danny-masterson-now-casts-a-shadow-over-that-39-70s-show>Danny Masterson Now Casts A Shadow Over That '70s Show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar42717180-1.jpg><p>Most readers are surely aware of the scandal surrounding Danny Masterson, and by extension, the rest of the That 70s Show<strong> </strong>cast. It's been years since the first very serious allegations against him came out, and while it has been a long road, with new victims coming forward to tell the story, a verdict was finally reached in early September 2023.</p><p>Masterson was sentenced to 30 years in prison on two counts of rape, in a trial that was nothing short of controversial and involved the Church of Scientology. The rest of the sitcom's cast have been following the case with different levels of interest, and those who decided to support Danny Masterson despite the gravity of the accusations against him and how definitive the verdict was have received almost as much backlash as the actor has.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several of his cast mates, <a href=#>including Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis</a>, Debra Jo Rupp, and Kurtwood Smith among the most notable names, have not only expressed their support but actively tried to help Danny reach a more favorable result in court. Fans won't let them forget it, and it seems that most of the cast of the iconic show might be pushed aside after this.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Danny Masterson's Stepfather Claims His Children Lied to Help The Actor In His Recent Trial</a></span></p><p>At the same time, those who have supported the victims, have been praised. Topher Grace, for instance, has been shown a lot of love when some of his old interviews came up where he said he wasn't interested in hanging out with the rest of the cast as friends.</p><p>Although he hasn't commented on the verdict, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his wife Ashley Hinshaw posted on her Instagram story</a>: "To every rape victim that is retraumatized by witnessing society debate and focus their attention on what is going to happen to the RAPIST… I see you." After that, there's not much more to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laura-prepon-is-staying-away-from-the-drama>Laura Prepon Is Staying Away From The Drama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/instar52347779-1.jpg><p>Not all That 70s Show alumni have been tainted by this, though. <a href=#><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a> have taken the brunt of the criticism since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they have unequivocally expressed that they don't think he should be held accountable</a> in letters they sent to the jury asking for leniency.</p><p>"While I’m aware that the judgment has been cast as guilty on two counts of rape by force and the victims have a great desire for justice, I hope that my testament to his character is taken into consideration in sentencing," one of the letters reads.</p><p>"I do not believe he is an ongoing harm to society and having his daughter raised without a present father would [be] a tertiary injustice in and of itself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Laura Prepon Managed To Keep Her Personal Life Private After All These Years</a></span></p><p>While all of this was going on, Laura Prepon, our beloved Donna, managed to do what's almost impossible in this day and age: she stayed away from the scandal. Laura has been one of the most successful actresses to come out of the show, with incredibly popular roles such as Alex Vause in the 7-season blockbuster Orange Is The New Black, but what has been keeping her busy recently is a much simpler but still important project.</p><p>Prepon has taken to YouTube to interact with her fans, and her channel has really taken off. She shares advice and stories on lots of subjects, including skincare tips, recipes, fashion, and more, and fans adore her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Away from all the drama that all her former co-stars seem to be caught up in (except for Topher Grace, of course), Laura seems to be moving on from the show without much trouble, which is admirable, since for a while <a href=#>she had been involved in the Church of Scientology</a>, and dated Christopher Masterson, her co-star's brother, for several years.</p><p>She apparently walked away from both long ago, though, so it makes sense that she would want to stay away. Right now, she's spending her time growing her channel and has continued posting videos and interacting with her viewers as usual, not even mentioning the Masterson drama.</p><h2 id=fans-love-laura-39-s-quot-prep-quot-in-the-kitchen>Fans Love Laura's "Prep" In The Kitchen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/instar52237720.jpg><p>One of the favorites of Laura's fans is PrepOn Kitchen, a series of recipes and cooking tips that she uploads on a daily basis to her YouTube channel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Ashton Kutcher Wasn't Pleased With The Announcement Of Laura Prepon's Engagement</a></span></p><p>She gets tons of comments in every video she posts, and the energy is always cheery and down to Earth.
