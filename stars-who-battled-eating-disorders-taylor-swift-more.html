She told Us Weekly exclusively in June 2021 that <a href=#>her habits were “obsessive and unhealthy”</a> — but she didn’t realize it right away.</p><p>“Honestly, it was a really long up and down journey of understanding food and understanding how I saw food and how my body received food,” the Dancing With the Stars alum explained at the time. “There was a lot of learning and a lot of patience and grace involved. … Now I don’t count or track calories. I’m just kind of eating clean, because I also know that food is a fuel and for what I do and it is important to eat healthy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to which celebs have bravely overcome their struggles.</p><p>If you or someone you know struggles with an eating disorder, visit the <a href=#>National Association of Anorexia Nervosa & Associated Disorders (ANAD) website</a> or call their hotline at (888)-375-7767 to get help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKCfYq%2BiwNOlnJ1llZbBqrrGZpuiq5%2Bnsaa%2B0mZpaWlhZ4Vw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meghan-markle-s-former-suits-costars-arrive-at-royal-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Meghan Markles Former Suits Costars Arrive at Royal Wedding</span></a>
