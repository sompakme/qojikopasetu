If we don't see ourselves on screen, it makes us think we don't belong in the world. And if we don't see other types of people on screen, we don't see them as a part of the world either. And that leads us to treat others differently.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How NBC’s New Show ‘Ordinary Joe’ Is Changing Disability Representation</a></span></p><p>This happens often with the disability community. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They make up a quarter of the population</a>, but they're rarely represented on screen. The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of the rare exceptions though, and that's one reason why <a href=#>it has become such a beloved film</a>. This past October <a href=#>a live-action concert performance of the classic film was produced</a>, so what better time to talk about this Christmas classic? Here are all of the ways the movie represents disability and is helping to change how we see the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dr-finkelstein-is-the-only-cartoon-character-in-a-power-wheelchair><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Dr. Finkelstein Is The Only Cartoon Character In A Power Wheelchair</strong></span></h2><p>There aren’t that many disabled characters to begin with, but there’s even fewer in cartoons. It’s rare to find any disabled animated characters. Along with Dr. Finkelstein, characters like Nemo, Dory, and Quasimodo are some of the most famous disabled cartoon characters. But sadly, there aren’t that many more disabled characters besides them. Most of the time, disabled characters are in the background and even in the new movies being made today, there are barely any disabled main characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dr. Finkelstein might not be the lead character, but at least he has a speaking part and is one of the more prominent characters. He’s also the first cartoon character to be in a power wheelchair. There’s barely any characters in wheelchairs, but when they are they’re usually in a manual wheelchair. Dr. Finkelstein shows viewers that there’s more types of wheelchairs out there besides manual ones.</p><h2 id=the-set-design-is-more-accessible-than-the-real-world><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>The Set Design Is More Accessible Than The Real World</strong></span></h2><p>Since Dr. Finkelstein is in a wheelchair, he has to be able to get around Halloween Town. Most of the time sets aren’t accessible if you really look at them because most of the disabled characters (if any) are in the background. The set is always designed for the main characters, so if the main characters aren’t disabled, it doesn’t have to be accessible. That ends up being a huge issue because whatever is on screen influences how people view the world and it makes them think the world doesn’t have to be accessible. It erases the whole disability community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the best things The Nightmare Before Christmas did was make a world that’s completely accessible. It has ramps all over so Dr. Finkelstein can get around and he’s not separated from the rest of Halloween Town (which is something that happens often in real life). Although things have become more accessible than they used to be, it’s not nearly enough. It’s really sad when a fictional place is more accessible than the real world.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>‘Run’ Star Kiera Allen Makes History For Disability Representation</a></span></p><h2 id=dr-finkelstein-breaks-a-couple-stereotypes><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Dr. Finkelstein Breaks A Couple Stereotypes</strong></span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is Dr. Finkelstein the first animated character in a power wheelchair, he also breaks a couple stereotypes. Even though it’s 2021, there are still some who believe negative stereotypes about disabled people. For some reason there is this stereotype that disabled people don’t work hard or have fulfilling lives. Most of that is to blame for the lack of representation. But The Nightmare Before Christmas changes that.</p><p>You can see Dr. Finkelstein works hard on his projects and he worked a lot to help Jack. He might have a hard time with Sally sometimes, but he seems to have a fulfilling life. He uses his brilliant mind to help everyone in Halloween Town and he definitely seems happy with his new girlfriend at the end.</p><p>He breaks the stereotype that people who are in wheelchairs can’t stand or walk too. You can see him standing a little bit when he’s working on the reindeer for Jack, which is common for people who can stand, but can’t walk long distances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Live Their Lives With Hidden Disabilities</a></span></p><h2 id=amputees-can-relate-to-sally><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Amputees Can Relate To Sally</strong></span></h2><p>Sally can be considered a disabled character too. She might not be in a wheelchair like Dr. Finkelstein, but she has a physical disability. She’s technically a monster, so her disability is not exactly the same as if she were a human, but disabled people can still relate to her. Amputees can relate to her being able to take off her limbs and put them back on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Writeups explains how she is able to take her limbs on and off: “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She fell from a window in Dr. Finkelstein’s tower and fell to bits… but then set about sewing herself back together.</a> When Dr. Finkelstein grabbed her arm, she was able to pull away, not out of his grip, but by undoing the stitches on her arm with her free hand so she could get away. She later dismembered herself when she tried to rescue Santa. She used one leg to distract Oogy Boogy, while her hands were sent down to free Santa.” She’s one of the only cartoon characters with this type of disability.</p><h2 id=the-disabled-characters-are-scary-characters><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>The Disabled Characters Are Scary Characters</strong></span></h2><p>The Nightmare Before Christmas will always be an awesome movie, but it's not good that the only disabled characters in it are the scary ones. It’s already bad enough that disabled characters are almost always in the background if they’re in the movie at all. But Hollywood seems to like making disabled characters villians or making them seem scary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quasimodo is viewed as a monster at first. Captain Hook is a villain. Dr. Finkelstein and Sally are both scary Halloween characters. Do you see the pattern? At least Dr. Finkelstein and Sally’s disabilities weren’t portrayed as something negative. They’re just citizens of Halloween Town living their lives (or technically afterlives) and using their disabilities to their advantage.</p><h2 id=the-movie-celebrates-diversity-and-shows-that-anyone-can-find-love><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>The Movie Celebrates Diversity And Shows That Anyone Can Find Love</strong></span></h2><p>The disabled characters in The Nightmare Before Christmas might be scary ones, but that’s really the only bad representation in it. The rest of the movie did an awesome job of representing the disability community. It was made years ago, but it’s still breaking stereotypes and helping disabled people know that they are so much more than the stereotypes others believe. And it shows how much better <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the world could be if we all accepted each other</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The movie also shows everyone that disabled people can find love and find their <a href=#>happily ever after</a>. For some reason there’s another stereotype that disabled people can’t be in relationships. But Sally and Jack prove that wrong. It might have taken Jack a while to realize Sally is his true love, but what they have is definitely special. And it shows that no matter who you are you can find your happily ever after.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Character In Pixar’s 'Luca' Is Changing The Way Kids View Disability</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilop%2BYqbqivsRmmZ6en6eybq%2FHq6CsrJ2WwG7AyKZkm62iqbyvecOiqpqamaG2tcWMq5ypqpWosq%2FAwK2gqKZdpby0tdOirZ5lnpq0osDIr5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-joey-marie-urbina-age-and-wikipedia-details-explored.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Joey Marie Urbina?
