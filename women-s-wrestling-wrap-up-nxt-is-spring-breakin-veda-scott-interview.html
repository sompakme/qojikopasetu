Two title matches have been added to WWE Backlash. STARDOM presents their All-Star Grand Queendom. Veda Scott speaks with WrestleZone and more!</p><h4>NXT Spring Breakin’ Preview</h4><p>It might be later than most, but WWE NXT will finally receive their Spring Break tonight as they host NXT Spring Breakin’. As of this writing, seven matches have been announced for the television special, including three contests involving the female superstars of NXT.</p><p>First, <a href=#>Indi Hartwell</a> will defend her NXT Women’s Championship against two of NXT’s fiercest competitors — <a href=#>Roxanne Perez</a> and Tiffany Stratton. <a href=#>Hartwell won the title</a> earlier this month, defeating five other women in a ladder match at NXT Stand & Deliver. The now former champion, Roxanne Perez, of course, wanted a shot to reclaim the gold. Following Perez’s victory over Zoey Stark last week, Hartwell offered to give Perez a shot at the title at NXT Spring Breakin’. Perez accepted, but another competitor wanted a shot as well. Cue Tiffany Stratton.</p><p>Stratton appeared on the stage with a microphone, stating that Hartwell’s title win was “pure dumb luck.” Stratton also claimed that Hartwell was handing out title matches to “beatable” opponents, such as Roxanne Perez. Perez and Stratton then exchanged some jabs, until Hartwell interrupted.</p><p>“At Spring Breakin’, I’ll prove I’m worthy by beating both of you!” Hartwell said. Now, Stratton and Perez will challenge Hartwell for the NXT Women’s Championship in a triple-threat match.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Also on the card is a singles match between Cora Jade and Lyra Valkyria. Since returning to NXT three weeks ago, Cora Jade’s list of enemies has grown even larger. So, after her victory over Gigi Dolin last week, Lyra Valkyria wanted a go at her.</p><p>NXT Spring Breakin’ will also feature a mixed tag team match between former friends. Fallon Henley and Josh Briggs will team up to take on Brooks Jensen and Kiana James. Henley and James were former NXT Women’s Tag Team Champions, but internal drama caused them to lose focus, and ultimately lose their titles to Alba Fyre and Isla Dawn. Now, the former tag team partners find themselves on opposite sides of the ring.</p><p><a href=#>NXT Women’s Title Match And More Set For 4/25 WWE NXT Spring Breakin’</a></p><h4>Two Women’s Title Matches Set For Backlash</h4><p>In less than two weeks, WWE will gear up for Backlash in San Juan, Puerto Rico. This past week, the company has announced that both their main roster singles women’s championships will be on the line there.</p><p>After entangling herself in the chaos between the LWO and The Judgement Day, <a href=#>Zelina Vega</a> wanted an opportunity to prove herself in a one-on-one capacity. Vega wanted to challenge <a href=#>Rhea Ripley</a> for the SmackDown Women’s Championship at Backlash.</p><p>Vega <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">previously told</a> WrestleZone’s Bill Pritchard she <a href=#>hoped to compete</a> at Backlash. Last week, she pitched her case to WWE official Adam Pearce. Vega is also of&nbsp;Puerto Rican descent, so it’d only be fitting for her to compete for the title in Puerto Rico. It appeared that Pearce agreed, as WWE later confirmed that Rhea Ripley will defend her championship against Vega at the premium live event on May 6.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rhea Ripley isn’t the only woman defending her title at the event though. RAW Women’s Champion <a href=#>Bianca Belair</a> will also put her title on the line against Damage CTRL’s<a href=#> IYO SKY</a>.</p><p>On the April 10 edition of RAW, SKY entered a triple threat match to determine the number one contender for Belair’s championship. There, she competed against Mia Yim and Piper Niven. In the end, SKY delivered a moonsault to break up a pinfall attempt by Yim on Niven. As Niven rolled away in pain, SKY took advantage, pinning Mia Yim for the win. She now receives her first televised singles title shot on the main roster.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><a href=#>WWE Raw&nbsp;Results&nbsp;(4/24/23)</a></p><h4>Major Title Changes Occur At STARDOM’s All-Star Grand Queendom</h4><p>Over in Yokohama, Japan, STARDOM held its first-ever All-Star Grand Queendom event on Sunday, April 23. Amongst the stacked card were several championship bouts, and several title changes. Three of the title changes particularly stood out though.</p><p>Firstly, <a href=#>Mercedes Moné</a> laid her IWGP Women’s Championship on the line against “The Icon of STARDOM” Mayu Iwatani. Moné did her best to wear down her challenger, but in the end, Iwatani stood victorious after stunning Moné with a dragon suplex. Moné’s reign has officially ended at 64 days, and Iwatani begins her first reign with a huge target on her back.</p><p>Despite her loss, Moné&nbsp;warned Iwatani that she’d be a “dead b*tch” the next time she saw her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=ja dir=ltr>IWGP女子王者から陥落した <a href=#>#メルセデス・モネ</a> は悔しさを滲ませ、リベンジを誓う<br>「私が誰かわかってる？私はリビングレジェンド。（中略）チャンスが欲しい。もう一度ベルトを懸けてやらせて！私にとって新日本、スターダムは終わりじゃない！私のワールドツアーも終わりじゃない！」<a href=#>#STARDOM</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WqbhVHdqux</a></p>— スターダム✪STARDOM (@wwr_stardom) <a href=#>April 23, 2023</a></figure><p>Moné&nbsp;wasn’t the only woman to lose a major championship that night. Giulia attempted to defend her World of Stardom Championship against Tam Nakano. Unfortunately for Guilia, her reign came to a close as well as Nakano scored the victory, crowning her as the new World of STARDOM Champion.</p><p>As she closed in on 500 days as the Wonder of STARDOM Champion, Saya Kamitani defended her title against Mina Shirakawa on Sunday. That match emerged as the second longest of the evening as Kamitani and Shirakawa fought for nearly 18 minutes. In the end, Kamitani’s lengthy reign finally came to an end at 480 days as Shirakawa won the battle.</p><p>Below are the full results for All-Star Grand Queendom:</p><ul><li>Mai Sakurai</li><li>Oedo Tai (Momo Watanabe, Natsuko Tora, Ruaka & Saki Kashima) defeat Club Venus (Jessie, Mariah May & Xena) & Thekla</li><li>Mei Seira & Starlight Kid defeat AZM & Mei Suruga</li><li>Queen’s Quest (Miyu Amasaki & Utami Hayashishita) defeat Fuwa-chan & Hazuki</li><li>Maika defeated Himeka</li><li>God’s Eye (Ami Sourei & MIRAI) defeat Neo Stardom Army (Nanae Takahashi & Yuu) (c) by Count Out</li><li>REstart (KAIRI, Natsupoi & Saori Anou) defeat Prominence (Hiragi Kurumi, Risa Sera & Suzu Suzuki) (c)</li><li>Mina Shirakawa defeated Saya Kamitani (c)</li><li>Knockout Or Submission Only: Syuri defeated Chihiro Hashimoto by KO</li><li>Mayu Iwatani defeated Mercedes Mone (c)</li><li>Tam Nakano defeated Giulia (c)</li></ul><p><a href=#>Mercedes Moné Loses IWGP Women’s Title, Set To Appear At NJPW Resurgence</a></p><h4>INTERVIEWS:</h4><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Professional wrestling commentator Veda Scott spoke with <a href=#>WrestleZone’s Ella Jay</a> about their recent work for NJPW, finding their voice behind the commentary desk, how it felt to call an AEW International Championship match, helpful feedback they’ve received, and much more.</p><p>WWE’s Dakota Kai and IYO SKY spoke with <a href=#>WrestleZone </a><a href=#>Managing Editor Bill Pritchard</a> about when it clicked that Damage CTRL was really going to work out as a faction, if they learned anything from working with Trish and Lita, other legends they might want to work with, and more.</p><p>WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus appeared on <a href=#>Busted Open Radio</a> to discuss her recent attitude change, WrestleMania 39, her current rivalry with Becky Lynch, and more.</p><p>NXT Superstar Zoey Stark joined <a href=#>Ring the Belle</a> to discuss her glow-up since joining WWE, the best finishers in the WWE, a potential main roster call-up, receiving praise from Molly Holly, and more.</p><p>Former SmackDown Women’s Champion Natalya chatted with <a href=#>Graham “GSM” Matthews</a> about taking part in this year’s women’s Elimination Chamber match, the evolution of women’s wrestling in WWE, celebrating 15 years on the main roster, what movie she would want to parody, and more.</p><h4 id=h-results>RESULTS:</h4><p>– April 22</p><ul><li>Christina Marie&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Ultra Violette</li><li>JC Storm defeated Emily Jaye</li><li>Brittany Jade&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Ella Envy</li><li>Leila Grey&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Katie Arquette</li><li>Megan Bayne&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Rebecca Scott</li><li>Missa Kate&nbsp;defeated Nikii Duke</li><li>Vita VonStarr&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Zoey Skye</li><li>MCW Women’s Title&nbsp;Iron Man:&nbsp;Gia Scott&nbsp;(c) defeated&nbsp;Ray Lyn&nbsp;(30:00) [4:2]</li></ul><p>– April 22</p><ul><li>Mission Pro Cup:&nbsp;Casey Blackrose&nbsp;defeated Max Heights</li><li>RCW Phoenix Championship: Alejandra Lion&nbsp;defeated&nbsp;Vanity&nbsp;(c)</li><li>Emmy Camacho defeated&nbsp;Mia Friday</li><li>Tiffany Nieves&nbsp;defeated Shay Karmichael</li><li>MPW Tag Team Title&nbsp;#1 Contendership:&nbsp;The Men’s Revolution (Joey Hyder & JP Harlow) defeat The King Bees (Charity Kane&nbsp;&&nbsp;Danni Bee) by Count Out</li><li>Mystii Marks&nbsp;defeated Dream Girl Ellie</li><li>MPW Tag Team Championships:&nbsp;The Money Birds (Gigi Rey&nbsp;&&nbsp;Lady Bird Monroe) defeat&nbsp;Bougie Reality&nbsp;(Madi Wrenkowski&nbsp;&&nbsp;Rache Chanel) (c) by DQ</li><li>MPW Championship:&nbsp;Jennacide&nbsp;(c) defeated&nbsp;Hyan</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJvb2pvZmLEsLnEp6pmr6KawLW1zaBksKqRpXq2vIynr61lo6W%2FqrrGZpmrnZGgtq951rCcZpqRmLitrdKhZK%2BdlJZ6tK%2FOras%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shane-keisel-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Shane Keisel Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
