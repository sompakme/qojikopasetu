Say what you want about him and his infamous brother Logan, but the two of them certainly don't shy away from any attention given to them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It all started back in the early 2010s when Jake and Logan became superstars on various social media platforms. Logan got his start on Vine, while Jake really popped off due to his Youtube videos. Every week, the guy was going viral, whether it was because of beef with another Youtuber, or because of his really controversial rap songs.</p><p>Jake has shelved his rap career, swapping it out for his newfound love of boxing. In just a few fights, he's become a must-see fighter, if only because of his controversial status. He's battled it out with famous boxing names such as Anderson Silva and Ben Asken, and more fights are on the way in the near future. He's made a lot of money from fighting, but how has it compared to his internet income? Let's find out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-jake-paul-39-s-net-worth>What Is Jake Paul's Net Worth?</h2><p>Jake Paul might be rich now, but he grew up just another middle-class kid from Ohio. Back in 2013, he started uploading videos to Youtube and Vine and ended up becoming an overnight sensation. Of course, Jake turned it up to another notch in 2017 when he exploded to A-list stardom. His appearances on Disney Channel and his viral song "It's Everyday Bro" cemented Jake as one of the biggest social media stars of all time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Were Jake Paul And Tana Mongeau Actually Married?</a></span></p><p>There's no doubt that at this point in his young career, Jake has racked up a lot of money. Beyond social media and boxing, Jake's other streams of income include comedy, music, and merchandising. Both Jake and his brother Logan have dipped their feet into cryptocurrency. Jake in particular has invested in an NFT game and has also purchased a vast collection of personal NFTs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jake-paul-holding-money.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jake has a net worth of $30 million. He's lost a few million after some high-profile lawsuits over the years, but that's where he's currently standing.</p><h2 id=this-is-how-much-money-jake-paul-has-made-from-social-media>This Is How Much Money Jake Paul Has Made From Social Media</h2><p>It appears that the bulk of Jake's net worth has come from his early social media days. By 2019, Jake had made $21.5 million from his various social media profiles. Of course, a lot of this money would be spent on various investments, as well as some items that wouldn't exactly bring Jake a return on investment.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Strange Truth About Jake Paul And Olivia Rodrigo's Relationship</a></span></p><p>One asset that Jake purchased back in 2017 was a giant sprawling mansion used for his Youtube videos. He hosted a lot of vlogs in that house, as well as some parties that weren't fit for his young fanbase's eyes. According to Jake's initial video about that mansion, he paid somewhere around $7 million for the lavish estate. That mansion was publicly put on the market in 2021 and was sold for a loss of nearly $1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jake-paul.jpg><p>Jake is still big on social media, even if it's not his primary source of entertainment. Most of his posts nowadays are about his boxing career, but he will still post about other things. Some of his recent non-boxing-related posts include a picture of the Dubai skyline, a picture of him posted on a private jet, and a bunch of pictures featuring his dog Thor Puppy Paul. Jake has also worked with the Cleveland Browns to sign a fake contract and uploaded the whole ordeal to Instagram and Youtube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=this-is-how-much-money-jake-paul-made-from-boxing>This Is How Much Money Jake Paul Made From Boxing</h2><p>A lot of people thought that when Jake first talked about boxing that he was joking. Even to this day, it still seems that a lot of critics don't take Jake's fighting seriously. With that being said, Jake's been professionally fighting for nearly 5 years, and it doesn't seem he's going to slow down anytime soon.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jake-and-Logan-Paul.jpg><p>Before when Jake was a social media icon, he was beefing with a lot of other internet celebrities. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jake has had beef with everyone from Conor McGregor to Pete Davidson</a>. One time he even got into an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">alleged altercation with popstar Zayn Malik</a>. Some folks <a href=# rel=nofollow>think Jake is a little egregious</a> when he mocks celebrities such as Conor, but his public brawls clearly help him bring in the big bucks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Pete-Davidson-and-Jake-Paul.jpg><p>Those beefs served as a bridge between his social media life and his boxing career, as his first match was against fellow Youtuber Deji Olatunji. Deji is the brother of another social media giant, KSI. While the brothers have had problems with one another, both of them have had longtime beefs with both of the Paul brothers.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>A Timeline Of Jake And Logan Paul's Boxing Career</a></span></p><p>After defeating Deji back in 2018, Jake moved on to fighting another Youtuber AnEsonGib. After that victory, Jake officially ranked up to fight real fighters such as Nate Robinson, Ben Askren, and Tyron Woodley. In October 2022, Jake fought big name Anderson Silva, and gave the heavyweight a rare loss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It seems that boxing has made for an even bigger payday for Jake. According to Forbes, Jake made $40 million in 2021 alone from fighting. Those would be the fights with Nate, Ben, and Tyron, all 3 of which were some of the most-watched matches from that year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Jake-Paul-Blasts-Tommy-Fury.jpg><p>Meanwhile, Jake received a standard check of $1.5 million from the Anderson Silva fight. In addition to that, Jake received a 65% share of the PPV revenue, while Anderson got 35%. According to The Sun, Jake's potential total earnings from the fight could've been $18 million.</p><p>All in all, Jake has already made more money from boxing than he has from social media; however, it hasn't been a huge difference so far. Jake will continue to earn more money, which is probably why he's been so obsessed with boxing over the last 5 years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jake has an upcoming match with boxer Tyson Fury. Jake has already talked a lot of smack and has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">made some interesting predictions</a> regarding the fight's outcome. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jake is also eyeing an official MMA debut soon</a>, though he still has yet to confirm anything regarding those endeavors. Jake is also still recovering from his recent breakup with Julia Rose. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jake claimed he was "devastated"</a> after his breakup with Julia, and has channeled that energy into his professional career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqOVYr2iwctmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpyaqp6eu6i%2FjKymnKGRoXquscOimGaan622r7OMrJilmaKufA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-fernandes-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>George Fernandes Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
