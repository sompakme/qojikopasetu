Now, the actor has launched his very own designer brand, God’s True Cashmere, but the prices aren’t for the faint of heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Mr. And Mrs. Smith star began <a href=#>working on the brand in 2019</a> alongside Amrit jewellery designer Sat Hari. The label started selling its first pieces a year later. On Thursday, the brand made its debut on London’s Selfridges department stores.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Nick Cannon Just Bought His Pregnant Baby Mama A House</a></span></p><p>In a new interview with <a href=#>Vogue</a>, Brad explained he partnered with Sat because of their shared passion for sustainable, soft fabric.</p><p>"[Cashmere] has elegance, quality, and comfort," Brad explained of their leading fabric. "It's also something that you can keep for a lifetime—something you can hand down and become heirlooms."</p><p>God’s True Cashmere doesn’t just prioritize high-quality fabrics. All their pieces use the finest materials available, including the button.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The brand’s showstopper is a collection of long-sleeve, button-down shirts featuring gemstones in replace of buttons. The shirts feature semi-precious stones, like amethyst, rose quartz, moonstone, and emerald, which are meant to symbolize values like wealth, love, and wisdom.</p><p>Given the high-quality materials, it’s no surprise that each shirt costs over a grand – $1,640, to be exact.</p><p>The all-cashmere collection also includes a unisex hoodie ($1,905) and a pair of plaid pants ($1,780).</p><p>"I say just wear what makes you feel good," Brad said. "Wear what's fun, do it, and get on with it!"</p><p>Brad may be celebrating a new milestone with his designer brand, but he’s currently embroiled in various legal issues that are also capturing his attention (and a significant portion of his wealth).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor is currently suing his ex-wife Angelina Jolie for selling her stakes in their French vineyard Château Miraval to Yuri Shefler. He claims Angelina sold her stakes to the Russian businessman with the intention of ruining his reputation.</p><p>“<a href=#>She sold her interest</a> with the knowledge and intention that Shefler and his affiliates would seek to control the business to which Pitt had devoted himself and to undermine Pitt’s investment in Miraval,” the lawsuit claims.</p><p>Earlier this month, Brad settled a years-long lawsuit brought forth by Hurricane Katrina victims, after his company Make It Right built faulty houses. The business was <a href=#>ordered to pay $20.5 million in compensation</a>. Make It Right has also partnered with Global Green to correct the defective work.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Rachel DeLoache Williams Sues Netflix For Her Portrayal In ‘Inventing Anna’</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Vogue</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8GrmJ1loJ7BtXnJrqqtZZyWwq%2Bvx56bZqCZqHqww81mm56rmZy7pr6Mm6mappRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./black-man-gets-questioned-for-looking-at-a-white-woman.html><span>←</span><span>Black Man Gets Questioned For Looking At A White Woman</span></a>
