Her late mother, Marcheline Bertrand, was also an actress. Jolie’s star continued to rise after she won a Golden Globe Award for her role in the 1997 film George Wallce. She went on to earn another Golden Globe as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award for 1998’s Gia and took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role in 1999’s Girl, Interrupted.</p><p>After starring in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in 2001, Jolie gained international recognition and solidified her reputation as a female action star. Jolie starred as the titular character in 2014’s Maleficent and expanded her talents into directing with the documentary A Place in Time (2007). She later directed Unbroken (2014), By the Sea (2015) and First They Killed My Father (2017).</p><p>Following her splits from ex-husbands <strong>Jonny Lee Miller</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Billy Bob Thornton</strong></a>, Jolie moved on with <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>. The pair worked together on Mr. & Mrs. Smith — which filmed while Pitt was still married to <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong></a> — and subsequently began dating. They got engaged in 2012, tying the knot two years later. The couple share six children, three of whom were adopted.</p><p>Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016. As the former couple battled for custody, Jolie accused Pitt of being “physically and emotionally abusive,” which he denied. Pitt later sued his ex-wife over ownership of their stake in the French vineyard Château Miraval.</p><p>Apart from her acting, Jolie is known for her humanitarian efforts. Jolie has advocated for refugees, women’s rights, education and conservation, among other issues. She was awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 2013 and was presented with an Honorary Dame title by <a href=#>Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 2014 for her humanitarian work.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnkaO0prjIp5hmop%2BhtqZ7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-actress-vanessa-rubio-as-carmen-diaz-in-cobra-kai.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Actress, Vanessa Rubio As Carmen Diaz In Cobra Kai?</span></a>
