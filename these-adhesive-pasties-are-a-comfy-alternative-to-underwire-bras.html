No bedtime, no curfew! Want to stay up late watching TV on a school night? Go for it! Craving fast food instead of a healthy meal? Get in your car and head to the drive-thru! Don’t feel like wearing a bra? <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">No bra, no problem!</a></p><p>Back in the day, I prayed for my boobs to grow so I could finally fit into a real bra (the life of a late bloomer). But by the time I finally hit puberty, lingerie lost its novelty — and now I never want to wear a bra again! Bras make me feel like I’m locked in a metal cage with underwire rubbing against my ribs. Ditch the torture devices and feel free with these <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">nipple pasties </a>instead!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Quxiang 5 Pairs Pasties Nipple Covers</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$11</a> (originally $15) at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, August 22, 2023, but are subject to change.</strong></p><p>These pasties provide comfort and coverage at the same time — no nip slips here! Simply stick on these <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reusable adhesives</a> to cover up your chest. Painless and modest! I particularly love this five-pack of pasties because you can reuse them time and time again, and they retain their stickiness! And they also come in a cute pink pouch for travel.</p><p>If you’re new to the world of nipple covers, allow me to explain their effectiveness. How many times have you struggled to find the right bra to wear with a backless dress or a top with a plunging neckline? Even strapless bras don’t always work with every outfit! Throw away the fashion tape — I have a better solution. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Made wth lightweight silicone</a>, these pasties smooth down your nips so they’re hidden underneath clothing. Plus, you don’t have to count down the hours until you can take your bra off at home! Bye-bye, bras!

Sure, there’s not as much support, but I’d trade comfort for cleavage any day!</p><h2><strong>Other Nipple Covers We Love:</strong></h2><p><strong>Not quite done shopping yet?
