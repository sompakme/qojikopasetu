Instead, she intends to focus on her music and release a new album following 2020’s Smile.</p><p>While Perry is forfeiting her spot at the judge’s table, she previously revealed her idea for her perfect replacement.</p><p>“I gotta say <strong>Jelly Roll</strong> was crazy when he came on the show. I was convinced at anything he said,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a> in April. “He could run for president, he could be my pastor, I might go back to church for him. He could sell me anything … To have any of these guys plus Jelly on the show would be amazing. I love you, Jelly!”</p><p>Jelly Roll, 39, has been a good sport about the suggestion, gushing that “of course” he would love to join the judges’ table with <strong>Luke Bryan</strong> and <strong>Lionel Richie</strong>.</p><p>“Consider? I’ve accepted the job and they haven’t offered it,” Jelly Roll joked when asked at Stagecoach in April about whether he’d consider the gig.</p><p>ABC has not yet announced who will take Perry’s spot when the show returns for Season 23.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Perry got emotional during the three-hour Idol finale on Sunday, where there were many tributes to her career. The ladies of the Top 12 performed a montage of “Teenage Dream,” “Dark Horse” and “California Gurls” on stage as Perry prepared to say goodbye to the competition show.</p><p>Ahead of the finale, Perry already knew it would be a tough episode to film.</p><p>“I think I will be crying at anything,” the singer said in an interview shared by KABC. “It’s been a beautiful journey and I love watching these kids grow and becoming this big beautiful patchwork quilt.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKarKlivaa%2B0bJknJmcocBurdGimKeZXZy%2ForrDnmStoJVir6a%2F02aqoqaXmr9uu8Vmpq6qXZyyr7HRmquip55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./judge-reinhold-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Judge Reinhold Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
