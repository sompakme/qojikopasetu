My mother-in-law was sitting there about three rows back and even got a shot in the poster, but it was a great night for us because we had so much fun. We captured the World Heavyweight Championship and ruled the SmackDown kingdom like no one else before us or after us. The King and Queen—King Booker and Queen Sharmell—will go down as the greatest duo that came from the King Of The Ring [tournament] and it will go down in history in the annals of time. It was a great time in my career.”</p><p class=p3>Sharmell – “Same here. Memorable moments, definitely WrestleMania with Boogeyman and a mouth full of worms, I never thought I would see myself with that. [laughs] Kurt Angle, that was a great one, but definitely the favorite was Booker and Rey Mysterio with Booker winning the championship. It’s been an amazing ride.”</p><p>Beginning Next Sunday, October 18th, fans can tune in and watch the event&nbsp;(recorded on October 10)&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Reality of Wrestling’s official YouTube</a>&nbsp;channel.</p><p>Booker T’s title win over Rey Mysterio can be seen in full below; we’ve also added a few other full-length matches to the list below that feature some of Booker’s biggest title matches in WWE.</p><p><br>WWE RAW — July 30, 2001</p><p><br>WWE SummerSlam — August 19, 2001</p><p><br>WWE The Great American Bash —&nbsp;July 23, 2006</p><p><br>WWE SummerSlam — August 26, 2007</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFpbWxoYWKvsLvKnqlmrF2otaK%2BzJ6jpWWWlsOwvsitnGaqn66urXnMqKSepqRir7C7xp6wppme</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./25-best-affordable-beauty-products-used-by-kim-kardashian-s-makeup-artist-mario.html><span>←</span><span>25 Best Affordable Beauty Products Used By Kim Kardashian's Makeup Artist, Mario</span></a>
