Throughout the chat, the two discussed several different topics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Among them, was Conan speaking about meeting a hero who he was in awe of growing up. Conan added that it is rare to be in awe of a celebrity. Sandler agreed, but revealed that he got that type of feeling after meeting Taylor Swift, especially given how much his daughters love her.</p><p>Sandler tells Conan, "You know what, Taylor Swift, because of what she means to my kids. I get a little f****** jumpy, cause I don't want to blow it for my kids. I talk a little too loud, I don't act as cool as I can get."</p><p>Sandler adds, "So many smash hits, there isn't a word my kids don't know. Remember The Beatles? Every song on the record you knew. That's Taylor Swift too. There's not a song you skip. That's pretty darn cool."</p><p>Conan agreed with Sandler that very few people have hit that level of fame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot-2024-02-26-at-10-42-51-am.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Travis Kelce Is Reportedly Struggling With Taylor Swift’s Strict Rules As He Joins Her On Tour</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor has high expectations for her relationship. but Travis allegedly doesn't agree with all of her rules.</span><p>Fans loved how open Adam was about his experience with Taylor Swift.

Speaking alongside <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a></strong>, Lautner revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did backflips on stage with Taylor Swift given how nervous he was</a>. You really can't make this stuff up...</p><p>"I do this weird thing, and it doesn’t make sense so forgive me, when I freak out and I’m really nervous and I black out, I just go straight to backflip."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I stepped out of this door, and I saw this walkway, and it was like 60 yards down the field. And I’m like, ‘I have to walk down this whole thing? This is going to be so uncomfortable,'" Lautner explained to host Jimmy Fallon. "And I was like, ‘Just backflip, and I’ll take up the space, and it’ll be over.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/joey-king-1.jpg> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-11t143656-298.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift Fans Were Furious Over The Alleged "Ego" Rule She Enforced On New Hires</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's apparent rules for her employees has caused tension among Swifties.</span><p>Lautner was very surprised about Swift's request to appear in her music video. Ultimately, both stars had praise for one another and the overall experience.</p><p>Swift revealed, “He was a very positive force in my life when I was making the Speak Now album, and I want to say he did every single stunt that you saw in that music video. He and his wife have become some of my closest friends, and it’s very convenient because we all share the same first name.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lautner added, “I respect you so much. Not just for the singer you are, the songwriter, the performer — but truly for the human you are. You are gracious, humble, kind and I’m honored to know you."</p><p>Great to see the two on such good terms.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-admitted-she-faced-nervous-moments-of-her-own-throughout-her-career>Taylor Swift Admitted She Faced Nervous Moments Of Her Own Throughout Her Career</h2><p>We're not quite sure if Taylor Swift gets starstruck by anyone. However, like everyone else, she gets nervous prior to performances. Swift opened up about what calms her down prior to hitting this stage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screen-shot-2024-02-23-at-4-25-08-pm.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I get pretty nervous. I kind of like go through, you know when you talk to yourself in the mirror? And I'm like, 'They're not going to throw things at you, it's going to be OK, it's going to be OK.' It's not like that, it's more like, 'Mmm ... it's going to be OK?' I don't get nervous when I'm going on stage and a crowd of people have bought tickets to see me, because I'm like, 'You guys totally want to be here.' It's when I'm not sure if people want me to be on stage," she revealed back in 2012.</p><p>We assume the nervousness is still there, but Swift has handled it with nothing but grace and class.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYnZmdYsCiusOlnKtlpJ28trPHrapmp55iwaLFy6ipZqunnrO1ecOuqaKml2K1qr%2BMoqWtnaKrtqbDjLCgraBdmLyvrc1mppuqmZq7br%2FUq6eroaOasW6ywKeqZqGeYsGpsYybnKysXayuunnPqKqsoZKhsnA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tina-lai-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Tina Lai Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
