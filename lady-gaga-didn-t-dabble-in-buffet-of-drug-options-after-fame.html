Filming the remake of the 1937 drama hit close to home for the pop star, who said in a new interview that drugs were readily available to her after she became famous.</p><p>“There was a buffet of options,” Gaga, 32, told the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> in a profile published on Thursday, August 30. “It’s very lonely being a performer. There’s a certain loneliness that I feel, anyway — that I’m the only one that does what I do. So it feels like no one understands. And the urge to use is because you’re searching for a way to quell the pain.”</p><p>The six-time Grammy winner recalled that “there was stuff everywhere” when she performed in New York City nightclubs before the 2008 release of her debut single, “Just Dance.”</p><p>“But I had already partied when I was younger so I didn’t dabble,” she clarified to the newspaper. “I was able to avoid it because I did it when I was a kid.”</p><p>Gaga (real name Stefani Germanotta) did not let her surroundings stop her from being a go-getter, though.</p><p>“When I wanted to become a singer, I hit the concrete running,” she said. “I was dragging my piano from dive bar to dive bar to play music. I was calling people, faking being my own manager to get gigs. I really believed in myself that I could do this and that I wasn’t going to stop until I made it. … The truth is, if we were not sitting here today and I hadn’t sold as many records as I have, I’d still be in a bar somewhere playing the piano and singing. It’s just who I want to be.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The “Bad Romance” singer has been candid through the years about her past with cocaine addiction.</p><p>“I was so unhappy,” she said on The Howard Stern Show in July 2011. “I think that I was lonely and there was something about the drugs that made me feel like I had a friend. … I did it all alone in my apartment while I wrote music. And you know what? I regret every line I ever did. … Don’t touch it. It’s the devil.”</p><p>A Star Is Born hits theaters on Friday, October 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZSueqitxppknaGUo8FusMCbmaWdXZ67bq7Un52erF2ks26w0a6eZqegqbawutJmmJ%2Bslad6p63MnmY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jared-golden-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Jared Golden Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
