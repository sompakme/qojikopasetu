Prepare yourself for some immense nostalgia as we work our way through ten '80s pop stars that we'd very much like to see make a comeback.</p><h2 id=culture-club>Culture Club</h2><p>One of the most popular British new wave groups in the '80s, Culture Club was fronted by the androgynous <a href=#>Boy George </a>who donned dresses, long locks and makeup.&nbsp; With a blend of reggae, dance, and pop, Culture Club sent hit after hit to the top of the charts with singles like Do You Really Want To Hurt Me, Time, and I'll Tumble 4 Ya.&nbsp; Boy George has battled addiction in the '90s, but the group did manage to release their first album in 20 years, Life, in 2018.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=spandau-ballet>Spandau Ballet</h2><p>Spandau Ballet was formed in London by brothers Gary and Martin Kemp and became a New Romantics sensation.&nbsp; In 1983, the group shot to international fame with their single True, a soulful take on British synth-pop.&nbsp; The song has become a classic, sampled countless times by hip-hop artists like P.M. Dawn, Lloyd, and Nelly.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Famous Pop Stars Who Give The Most Expensive Concerts</a></span></p><p>Lead singer Tony Hadley announced in July 2017 that he would leave the band.&nbsp; Hope he changes his mind!</p><h2 id=beastie-boys>Beastie Boys</h2><p>Beastie Boys began in New York City as a punk band, and it wasn't until the group embraced hip-hop elements in 1983 that they started to attract local attention and gain traction.&nbsp; Their 1986 album License to Ill, one of the first releases from <a href=#>Russell Simmons</a>' Def-Jam Recordings, climbed the billboard charts.</p><p>It would be pure wishful thinking that they would come back though.&nbsp; In 2012, Adam "MCA" Yauch died of cancer, and the group officially disbanded in 2014.</p><h2 id=the-go-go-s>The Go-Go's</h2><p>It's easy to remember the Go-Go's as one of the most popular girl-groups of the '80s, but they were also somewhat of a pioneer - an all-female group playing their own instruments and writing their own songs that hit mainstream success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their debut album Beauty and the Beat was a massive success in 1981, and with that came hard-partying, sex, and drugs.&nbsp; But the Go-Go's are already experiencing a resurgence these days, with their <a href=#>Broadway </a>show Head Over Heels.</p><h2 id=new-order>New Order</h2><p>Before they called themselves New Order, they were Joy Division in the late 1970s.&nbsp; By the time their classic song Love Will Tear Us Apart was released in 1980, frontman Ian Curtis committed suicide and Joy Division was no more.</p><p>The remaining members changed their name to New Order and transformed themselves into an electronic dance group, with iconic hits like Blue Monday and Bizarre Love Triangle.&nbsp; Their sound is still as cool today as it was decades ago, though Ian Curtis' absence is certainly tragic and worthy of remembrance.</p><h2 id=duran-duran>Duran Duran</h2><p>It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that every teenage girl in the '80s probably had a Duran Duran poster up on her bedroom wall!&nbsp; One of the most iconic groups of the decade, Duran Duran had everything - good looks, wealth, and fame, thanks to their hit-making prowess, with hits like Hungry Like the Wolf and Rio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>The 10 Richest Rock Stars of 2019</a></span></p><p>They struck gold again in the '90s with songs like Ordinary World and Come Undone, a rarity for an '80s group.&nbsp; The time may be ripe for another comeback, and it definitely seems more than possible with this one!</p><h2 id=depeche-mode>Depeche Mode</h2><p>Depeche Mode was formed in Essex, England in 1980, and with their brand of electronic pop, achieved huge international success in the decade.&nbsp; They produced a steady stream of hits like See You, Just Can't Get Enough, People Are People, and Enjoy the Silence.&nbsp; Like many young rock stars who experience explosive success, frontman Dave Gahan has struggled with heroin addiction in the '90s.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Best High-End Live Music Venues In Las Vegas</a></span></p><p>He's also had to deal with bladder cancer in the 2000s.&nbsp; Here's hoping for Dave's recovery so he can perform with the band again.</p><h2 id=eurythmics>Eurythmics</h2><p>The British duo Eurythmics was the epitome of style and substance in the 1980s.&nbsp; With an incredible vocal range, orange hair, and an androgynous style, Annie Lenox wowed the world with synth-pop hits like Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) and Here Comes the Rain Again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Annie embarked on a successful solo career in the '90s, but the world is most definitely more than ready for them to reunite again!</p><h2 id=bananarama>Bananarama</h2><p>The pop trio Bananarama was <a href=#>England's</a> hottest cool girl group in the '80s.&nbsp; Like their American counterpart the Go-Go's, Bananarama also wrote their own music, which is particularly noteworthy.&nbsp; Their hits were influenced by Motown and '60s pop, melded with '80s rhythm and harmonious melodies.</p><p>From 1982 to 1988, nine of their singles hit the Top 10 in the U.K.&nbsp; The three original ladies still look gorgeous today, and it's time to hear them sing Cruel Summer again!</p><h2 id=run-dmc>Run-DMC</h2><p>Hip-hop really entered into the cultural mainstream when Run-DMC hit the charts in the 1980s.&nbsp; They also hailed from Def-Jam Recordings, managed by Russell Simmons who happened to be the brother of Joseph Simmons or Run.</p><p>Who could forget You Be Illin' or Walk This Way, their collaboration with Aerosmith?&nbsp; Sadly, Jam Master Jay passed away in 2002, but their music and hip urban style live on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Famous Rock Bands Who Give The Most Expensive Concerts</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5naGXAbrzOqWSgqp%2BqvbR5zK6qopuZlru0ecCrq6KrpKh6r7HEnWScp52ar6Kvymg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-isabela-merced-ethnicity-parents-nationality-where-is-she-from.html><span>←</span><span>What Is Isabela Merced Ethnicity?
