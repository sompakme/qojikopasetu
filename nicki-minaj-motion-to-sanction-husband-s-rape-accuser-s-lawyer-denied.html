On Sunday (April 2), <a rel=nofollow href=#>AllHipHop</a> reported that a ruling was handed down in the case on March 30, with the court stating that Jennifer Hough’s—the rape accuser of Nicki’s husband <a href=# id=auto-tag_kenneth-petty data-tag=kenneth-petty>Kenneth Petty</a>—decision to file a motion for a default judgement wasn’t sanctionable despite Nicki’s claim that it “lacked merit.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The court does not find [Hough’s] decision to pursue a <a href=#>motion for default judgment</a> against [Nicki] sanctionable, notwithstanding [Nicki’s] claim that the motion lacked merit,” ruled Judge James R. Cho. “Here, [Hough] did not have an obligation to withdraw her motion for default judgment against Nicki simply because counsel for [Nicki] considered the motion ‘frivolous.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Yet, Judge Cho made it clear that his ruling was by no means a cosign of the antics of Tyrone Blackburn, Hough’s current attorney, in his client’s legal battle against the rap star. “Blackburn should not take the denial of the motion for sanctions as in any way endorsing his behavior,” the judge said of the lawyer, who painted the Pettys in a negative light.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1395053113.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Among claims made by Blackburn was the pair’s alleged <a href=#>gang affiliation with the Makk Baller Brims</a>, Minaj’s legal team engaging in unauthorized communication with Hough’s previous legal team, and other offensive remarks. Nicki’s lawyer, Judd Burstein, was displeased with the ruling, arguing that Blackburn’s statements were “inexcusable and wholly unsupported.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The ongoing back-and-forth between the Pettys and Hough has been happening for nearly two years. Hough filed a suit against the couple in August 2021, alleging defamation and witness intimidation. According to Hough, Minaj and Petty offered her $500,000 to drop the case and that she hired private detectives to stalk her and her family. Minaj, who has denied any wrongdoing, was ultimately dropped from the lawsuit due to a lack of court jurisdiction.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In December 2022, a judge ordered Petty and Hough <a href=#>to settle the lawsuit</a>, giving the pair a deadline to find a mediator to resolve the case. As of press time, a settlement between the two parties has yet to be reported.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1205858203.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O2pLfIZqSippGferStzZyroqeeYrW2v8GapZ1lopa9pnnAnJquq5Wneq2t1rKcq2VhZ4B1g5NvamtvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kansas-city-chiefs-win-playoff-game-against-buffalo-bills.html><span>←</span><span>Kansas City Chiefs Win Playoff Game Against Buffalo Bills</span></a>
