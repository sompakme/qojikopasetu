On Tuesday (Nov. 28), the 69-year-old took to Instagram with a scorching message for those hating on her eldest child and those insinuating that <a href=# id=auto-tag_beyonce data-tag=beyonce>Beyoncé</a> “wants to be white” after photos emerged from the <a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234821493>RENAISSANCE film premiere</a> where Bey appears to have a lighter complexion than usual.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Knowles reposted a fan-made video that featured the 42-year-old’s empowering anthem, “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234684901>BROWN SKIN GIRL</a>” over clips of Bey throughout the years. Towards the end of the video, it read, “Beyoncé is a brown skin girl. Sometimes, more or less light. A brown skin girl is more than a skin color. It’s a culture, a pride, a strength.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234775744> recent divorcee</a> began, “Came across this today and decided to post it after seeing all of the stupid ignorant self, hating racist statements about her, lightening her skin, and wearing platinum hair wanting to be white. She does a film, called the renaissance, where the whole theme is silver with silver hair, a silver carpet, and suggested silver attire and you bozos decide that she’s trying to be a white woman and is bleaching her skin?”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Knowles called out Black people who have perpetuated the “<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234777623>stupid narrative </a>with hate and jealousy.” However, what upset her the most was a white woman from TMZ reaching out to Beyoncé’s hairstylist, Neal Farinah, for a statement on Bey “wanting to be white.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Well that made my blood boil — that this white woman felt so entitled to discuss her blackness,” Knowles wrote. “What’s really most disappointing is that the some Black people yes you bozos that’s on social media. Lying and faking and acting like you’re so ignorant that you don’t understand. That black women have worn platinum hair since the Etta James days. I am sick and tired of people attacking her.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Knowles concluded, “Every time she does something that she works her a** off for and is a statement of her work ethic, talent and resilience, here you sad little haters come out the woodwork. Jealousy and racism, sexism , double standards , you perpetuate those things. Instead of celebrating a sister or just ignoring if you don’t like her, I am sick of you losers. I know that she is <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234808378>going to be pissed </a>at me for doing this, but I am fed up! This girl minds her own business. She helps people whenever she can. She lifts up & promotes black women and underdogs at all times.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Julez Smith — Bey’s nephew and Tina’s grandson — commented, “Talk to em grandma, They need it.” Others also rallied behind Mama Tina in defense of Beyoncé. Keke Palmer commented, “I love you so much, Ms. Tina! She deserves to be protected in this way!” Later, Cynthia Ervio chimed in, “Snaps to all this!! You have EVERY right to stand behind your baby girl!!!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Beyoncé has not shared anything on her personal Instagram since releasing the final trailer for RENAISSANCE: A Film By Beyoncé. It will be released this Friday (Dec. 1).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m2r62MpKWor5yawG6wxJ%2Bcp5yjYq%2Bmxc6nmp5lp5a7tb%2BMraZmmpVixKm1055kampjaYVzf5dxbWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-ultimate-2023-father-s-day-gift-guide.html><span>←</span><span>The Ultimate 2023 Father's Day Gift Guide</span></a>
