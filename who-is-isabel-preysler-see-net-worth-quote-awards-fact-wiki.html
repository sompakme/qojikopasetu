Preysler also worked as a spokesmodel for Ferrero Rocher, Suárez jewellery, Manolo Blahnik shoes, Chrysler cars, and Porcelanosa tiles, among others. Isabel has been an active member of the entertainment industry since 1970.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Isabel Preysler is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Preysler’s net worth is as high as $30 million, an amount earned through her successful, varied career including as a spokesmodel. In addition to being a trademark face for numerous large enterprises, Preysler has also worked as a journalist, and hosted several Spanish TV shows, which improved her wealth too.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=isabel-preysler-net-worth-30-million></span>Isabel Preysler Net Worth $30 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Isabel Preysler is a daughter of Carlos Preysler y Pérez de Tagle, the Philippine Airlines executive director and a member of the board of directors for Spanish Bank of Manila, and María Beatriz Arrastia y Reynares, the owner of a real estate company in Manila. She grew up in a wealthy family in Manila, the third of six children, and was educated at a private Roman Catholic school.</p><p>Isabel migrated to Madrid, Spain when she was 16, and lived with her uncle and aunt while she studied at Mary Ward College, and later at the Irish Catholic University. Her journalistic career began in 1970 when she started working for Spanish celebrity-news magazine ¡Hola!. Coincidentally, her first interview was with her future husband, Julio Iglesias. Preysler continued to work as a journalist and television host, and in 1995, she appeared in the TV movie “Telemaratón”, which certainly increased her net worth.</p><p>After that, Isabel played in eight episodes of the series “Corazón, corazón” (1996-2008), and hosted the talk-show called “Hoy en casa” (1998). In 2001, she appeared in “Telemaratón 2001: Diez años de sonrisas”, and after numerous other series and shows, she most recently played in the TV movie “Premios Goya 30 edición” (2016), adding further to her already impressive net worth.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Isabel Preysler was married to Julio Iglesias from 1971 to 1979 and has three children with him: Chabeli Iglesias (born in 1971), Julio Iglesias, Jr. (born 1973), and the singer Enrique Iglesias (born in 1975). Her second husband was Carlos Falcó, the Marquis of Griñón, from 1980 to 1985 and she has a daughter with him. In January 1988, Isabel married Miguel Boyer, a former Spanish finance minister, and has a daughter Ana Boyer (born in 1989) with him.</p><p>In the late September 2014, Boyer died, and since then, Isabel hasn’t remarried.</p><p>Preysler is a good friend with many celebrities, including Prince Charles, David and Victoria Beckham, Hillary Clinton, Shakira, and Yoko Ono, among many others.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Isabel Preysler</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 18, 1951</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Manila, Philippines</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 6 in (1.7 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Socialite</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Mary Ward College, Assumption Convent High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Spanish, Philippine</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Miguel Boyer (m. 1988–2014), Carlos Falcó (m. 1980–1985), Julio Iglesias (m. 1971–1979)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Enrique Iglesias, Chabeli Iglesias, Julio Iglesias, Jr., Ana Boyer, Tamara Falcó</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Beatriz Arrastía Reinares, Carlos Preysler Perez de Tagle</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Victoria Preysler Arrastia, Carlos Preysler Arrastia, Jr., Beatrice Preysler Arrastia, Joaquin Preysler Arrastia, Enrique Preysler Arrastia</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>María Isabel Preysler Arrastía , Maria Isabel Preysler Arr?stia , isabel_preysler</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1923355/</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Hoy</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>She is a niece of actress Neile Adams, a half-first cousin of Neile’s children, American actors Chad McQueen’ and Terry McQueen, and a half-first cousin, once removed, of Chad’s son, actor Steven R.
