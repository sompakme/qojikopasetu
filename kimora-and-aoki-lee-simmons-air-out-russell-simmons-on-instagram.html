On Monday (June 19), the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234744869>single mother</a> of five took to Instagram after her ex-husband <a href=# id=auto-tag_russell-simmons data-tag=russell-simmons>Russell Simmons</a> shaded her in a series of cryptic posts. They share two daughters, Ming and Aoki.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=#>Phat Farm founder</a> was seemingly set off the day prior when Ming, 23, wished Kimora, 48, a “Happy Father’s Day.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Russell, 65, shared an image that read, “Stop telling fathers they should have fought harder to see their children & start asking mothers why he had to fight at all.” The next post read, “The father you have is the perfect father for the evolution of your soul and the lessons that you needed to learn in this lifetime.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This led <a href=#>Kimora</a> and Aoki, 20, to address his shade and alleged threats on <a rel=nofollow href=#>Instagram Live</a>. The latter shared screenshots from a conversation between her and her father where he claimed Kimora had “stolen” his money and called her a “piece of s**t.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The recent<a href=#> Harvard graduate</a> wrote, “I’ve had enough… I was always a daddy’s girl. You can see that in any picture. But he’s been awful to me for years and that’s just the truth. It’s like talking to a cruel child or something, and no he does not support me financially.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Aoki does believe <a href=#>her father</a> is experiencing some sort of mental issue. She also shared a screen-recording of a FaceTime call with Russell (above) where he was visibly yelling angrily as she was very emotional.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3424-e1687272900518.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3422-e1687272987882.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">During Kimora’s Live, she claimed that Russell cut off Ming and Aoki, just before they were set to graduate. This piggybacked from Aoki’s allegation that he intentionally revoked access to her debit card while she was overseas, leaving her stranded. The <a href=# data-type=pmc-gallery data-id=1234684470>Baby Phat owner</a> mentioned that she’d been “carrying [him] financially over the past 10 years” when it came to keeping his companies afloat.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She also claimed that she has countless receipts to prove that Russell has been putting up a facade that he is on good terms with her and their children, which Kimora says “is far from the truth.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In separate posts shared to her stories, the <a href=#>retired supermodel</a> wrote, “I’m so sorry to have to do this, but this man has been threatening my kids’ lives. I’m hearing so much more now. We won’t be bullied threatened or afraid.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Later adding, “The same abusive ish. This is how you maneuver with the world and women all around you. Your threats and lies and intimidation maneuvers and tactics are sad. Stop it please. Your own flesh and blood? Enough is enough.” 18 women have <a href=#>accused Russell </a>of sexual misconduct, but he <a href=#>insists he’s innocent</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3437-e1687274535655.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Aoki also mentioned that Russell has even sent men to intimidate Ming at her apartment in the middle of the night and says he was drastically different before the accusations came to light.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Prior to his media issues, he was really the best dad ever and a great co-parent. He and my mom were best friends,” she wrote. “We<a href=#> all defended him</a> against anything, and then he suddenly turned on ANYONE who will let him lash out. It’s a really just terrifying change to watch.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_3438-e1687274576687.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Russell&nbsp;sued Kimora and her now ex-husband, Tim Leissner, in March 2021. He insinuated they tried to fraudulently transfer nearly $4 million of his shares in Celsius to help pay for Leissner’s bail and legal fees stemming from&nbsp;his 2018 <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234701010>money laundering</a> case. Kimora’s attorneys denied the claim and accused Russell of “extortive harassment.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She and Russell reportedly began dating while she was in high school. They wed in 1998 and divorced in 2009.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6C2rrvRmmSlnZViwKq5zKilrGWiqsC0sculZKyhnaK8r7%2BMmqakoV2axbG4wKKlnpxdZn90gJZvbHJqYGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ghost-story-podcast-top-ghost-story-podcasts-in-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Ghost Story Podcast Top Ghost Story Podcasts in 2024</span></a>
