They knew that there was a storylines and they built upon those and timelines were split and cut apart,” Murrel, 35, exclusively told Us Weekly on November 1, noting that the same went for <a href=#><strong>Kristin Cavallari</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Stephen Colletti</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong></a>’s onscreen drama during season 1. “Because <a href=#>it was shot like a soap opera</a> pretty much, it was hard for viewers to, like, understand if it was reality or real.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Mox Agency cofounder</a> raised eyebrows <a href=#>during season 2 of the MTV series</a>, which aired in 2005, when she took Wahler, now 35, to their Winter Formal dance while he was still dating Smith, also 35.</p><p>Once <a href=#>the “Let the Journey Begin” podcast cohost</a> and Smith called it quits on their romance, he quickly moved on with Murrel, but the marketing guru told Us <a href=#>the timeline wasn’t exactly what it appeared</a>.</p><p>“It just kind of blurred those lines ’cause [the show] was the first of its kind,” Murrel said while promoting <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a>‘s Netflix debut. “There was those [love triangle] story lines [and] things happened, but I think, like, with the editing, it really kind of piecemeal things together that maybe weren’t, like, a hundred percent.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Laguna-Beachs-Alex-Murrel-Recalls-%E2%80%98Contrived-Love-Triangle-With-Jessica-Smith-Jason-Wahler-It-Was-Like-a-%E2%80%98Soap-Opera-125-126.jpg><p>Following the show, which included a third season that aired in 2006, the teens grew up and found love outside of reality TV.</p><p>Murrel <a href=#>married <strong>Kyle Johnson</strong></a> in October 2014. The couple share three sons: <a href=#>Levi, 6, Kase, 4, and Rome, 19 months</a>. Jason, for his part, wed <a href=#><strong>Ashley Wahler</strong></a> (née Slack) in October 2013. The twosome share daughter Delilah, 5, and son Wyatt, 16 months.</p><p>Smith, who was one of Cavallari’s best friends on <a href=#>seasons 1 and 2 of the MTV show</a>, currently lives in Texas with her husband and their four kids.</p><p>Looking back on the childhood drama, Murrel confessed that <a href=#>she and Jason don’t often talk about their brief fling</a>, but they do stay in touch.</p><p>“I love Jason’s wife, Ashley. I mean, Jason and I maybe, like — and this is where it can be contrived — we, like, dated for … [it was a] high school relationship,” the Newport Beach, California, resident told Us earlier this month. “It was, like, a week or two and then that got piecemealed.”</p><p>Murrel concluded: “<a href=#>We were friends first</a>, always, and then friends after. We’re married [and have] kids [so] there’s no reason to talk about any of that anyway. We laugh about it, that’s for sure.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Laguna Beach seasons 1 and 2 hit Netflix on Friday, November 11.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOan6Wjrm6uxJqaoatdlrmmxIymrKuqlaF6pbHTmqClq12fsrS%2FyJyYZqKRqLyvecuorZ5lpKe2orrGpZxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jason-kelce-shades-travis-new-year-s-resolution-to-stop-eating-bacon.html><span>←</span><span>Jason Kelce Shades Travis' New Years Resolution to Stop Eating Bacon</span></a>
