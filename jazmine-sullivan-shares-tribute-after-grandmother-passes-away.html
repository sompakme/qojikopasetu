<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Jazmine Sullivan Shares Tribute After Grandmother Passes Away</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_jazmine-sullivan data-tag=jazmine-sullivan>Jazmine Sullivan</a> has posted a reflective tribute following her grandmother’s recent death. The <a href=#>GRAMMY award-winner</a> also referenced her mother several times throughout the post, as Sullivan lost her earlier this year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Rest now, grandmom,” she wrote on her Instagram story, sharing how her mother and grandmother shaped who she is today. “I know mommy is so happy to see you! These women are the very reason I sing and write. The reason I’m funny and sassy. The reason I say what I mean according do my conviction. The reason I love God! And the reason I’m strong even when I don’t think I am.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Bust Your Windows” singer concluded her message by saying how she’ll put her trust in a higher power to get through this tough chapter. “God decided 2023 I could handle losing them both. [I don’t know why] but his plans are above me. What I do know is that I was blessed to have been molded and loved fiercely by these amazing women. And I am proud to continue carrying myself in the light in which they raised me! God I thank you for my time with them! I’ll miss you grandma. Hug mommy for me,” she ended.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Screenshot-2023-12-29-at-3.01.44-PM.png><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This past summer, Sullivan shared the news that her mother, Pamela, <a href=#>had passed away</a> after her four-year battle with breast cancer. The songbird’s most recent Instagram post is a video of her mom wishing her a happy birthday. “Words cant express how much we love you, Jazmine,” Pamela says in the clip. “You are the light of our lives, and we thank God for you.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Many followers flooded the <a href=#>Heaux Tales</a> creator’s comments to share support. “We see you… beyond your gift we see you,” wrote content creator Deanna Dixon. “You’re experiencing a real human moment and we give you space to grieve and just be. And when you’re ready… we will be standing with open arms to support you again through this new territory.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Buu7nIp5xmq6WhuarCwKdkoKqRo7Guu9OhnKtloJbAtLHSZpiwmaliwbO1wa6rnmVhZ4B1hJJwaHBvXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./has-mama-june-spent-away-all-of-her-road-to-redemption-money-or-has-she-found-financial-stability.html><span>←</span><span>Has Mama June Spent Away All of Her Road To Redemption Money Or Has She Found Financial Stability?</span></a>
