From Ariana Grande’s puffy gown in 2020 to Destiny’s Child’s matching green dresses in 2001, celebrities dress to impress at the Grammys through the years.
Cher arrived at the 1974 Annual Awards Show in an ab-baring ensemble that included a sparkly butterfly headpiece and matching bra. Toni Braxton, for her part, took home two trophies in 2001 — one for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist and one for Favorite Soul/R&B Album for The Heat — in a dress held together on a wing and prayer, but not before Jennifer Lopez broke the then-fledgling internet in 2000 with her iconic nearly naked Versace gown."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Leather! Suits! When it comes to the <a href=#>Grammys</a>, Hollywood’s biggest names never fail to dazzle Us with their red carpet looks.</p><p>From <a href=#><strong>Ariana Grande</strong></a>’s puffy gown in 2020 to Destiny’s Child’s matching green dresses in 2001, celebrities dress to impress at the Grammys through the years.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Cher</strong> </a>arrived at the 1974 Annual Awards Show in an ab-baring ensemble that included a sparkly butterfly headpiece and matching bra. <a href=#><strong>Toni Braxton</strong></a>, for her part, took home two trophies in 2001 — one for Favorite Soul/R&B Female Artist and one for Favorite Soul/R&B Album for The Heat — in a dress held together on a wing and prayer, but not before <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> broke the then-fledgling internet in 2000 with her iconic nearly naked Versace gown.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a>’s 2011 look is perhaps the most extravagant of them all. The “Born This Way” singer arrived in an egg-like vessel designed by Hussein Chalayan. She was carried into the ceremony on a wooden ladder and even revealed to Vanity Fair in 2011 that she spent “three days” in the egg before the show.</p><p>In 2018, the night took a more poignant turn when celebs — men and women alike! — incorporated white roses into their ensembles in support of the Time’s Up movement, serving as an important reminder that <a href=#>fashion can be about more than glitz and glamor</a>. 2019, however, was all about show-stopping looks, like <strong><a href=#>Cardi B</a></strong>‘s vintage Mugler ensemble. Her elaborate number featured an oyster shell design around the skirt with the “I Like It” singer as the pearl. To make it even more glamorous, the New York native wore a pearls necklace as well as beads wrapped around her waist and updo.</p><p>At the 63rd Annual Awards show, <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>’ iconic getup was the talk of the night. The “As It Was” crooner stunted a Gucci getup. He wore a yellow tweed blazer with a striped sweater vest underneath, velvet pants and a show-stopping purple boa. Another killer look was <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>’s mini dress. The Oscar de la Renta number included 3-D flowers from the neckline to the bottom of the skirt. She styled her blonde tresses in a braided updo and looked as elegant as ever.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Olivia Rodrigo</strong></a> arrived at the 2022 red carpet in a custom Vivienne Westwood masterpiece. The gown featured a corset bodice, off the shoulder straps and black gloves. The “Drivers License” signer <a href=#>donned a winged eyeliner</a> look and<a href=#> loose curls in her hair</a>. <a href=#><strong>SZA</strong></a> also turned heads at the 64th annual show in a Jean Paul Gaultier frock. The tulle dress delicately wrapped around her body and had a stunning floral design on the bodice.</p><p>Keep scrolling to take a look back at the best styles throughout the decades at the Grammys!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvGq5impamoeqet0qGgqKZdl7K0wIysq7Kklah6tbTRqKygoF2ptaZ5w56ampyVqHw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dave-chappelle-s-net-worth-when-keeping-it-real-goes-right.html><span>←</span><span>Dave Chappelle's Net Worth: When Keeping It Real Goes Right</span></a>
