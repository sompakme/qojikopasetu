I’m begging you.”</p><p>Chelsea found some unlikely support in the form of actress <a href=#><strong>Julia Fox</strong></a> (no relation to Megan), who commented on the video. “Don’t worry sis, I see it,” Julia, 34, wrote.</p><p>Once Chelsea caught wind of Julia’s endorsement, she responded via her Instagram Stories, writing, “Internally screaming @juliafox. Girls girl.”</p><p>Chelsea also made light of the situation in a separate post in her Stories, <a href=# rel=noopener>reposting a meme</a> made by a viewer who wrote, “I feel like this is the new Gold and White vs. Black & Blue dress dilemma…IMO @chelseadblackwell absolutely looks like a young Megan Fox.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Love-Is-Blind-Chelsea-Begs-For-Backup-Surrounding-Megan-Fox-Comparisons-Julia-Fox.jpg><p>The reality star captioned the post, “Not the black and gold dress,” complete with a laughing crying face emoji.</p><p>Chelsea also <a href=#>responded to the controversy</a> in a separate TikTok video posted on Sunday, February 18, in which she was seen dancing and posing with a glass of wine while Led Zeppelin’s “Immigrant Song” played. She captioned the video: “Go on a show for love > get your butt dragged through the trenches.”</p><p>In the first episode of the Netflix dating show’s sixth season, Chelsea told podmate <strong>Jimmy Presnell</strong> that she is often compared to the <i>Transformers</i> star — even if she doesn’t quite agree.</p><p>“It’s just because I have dark hair and blue eyes,” Chelsea said. “But I don’t see it, so don’t get excited.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Love-Is-Blind-Chelsea-Begs-For-Backup-Surrounding-Megan-Fox-Comparisons-3.jpg><p>The comparison worked on Jimmy, 28, who responded, “Can we get married?”</p><p>Later, Jimmy followed through on that question and asked Chelsea to marry him. However, once the newly engaged couple left the pods, things took a turn.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The pair bickered about their time in the pods, especially after Jimmy confided in Chelsea that he thought about leaving the <a href=#><i>Love Is Blind</i></a> experiment early before proposing to her.</p><p>Further, Jimmy admitted in a confessional that he felt Chelsea lied to him about looking like Megan Fox, though said he was still “very” attracted to her.</p><p>The first nine episodes of <a href=#><i>Love Is Blind</i> season 6</a> are currently available to stream on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVitrR5waWgp5yjYrCpscusnJplp5a7tb%2BMm5ico6Wleqe70Waknp%2BRo3qnu9dmmqiloJa%2Fqr%2FOp6po</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./khloe-kardashian-throws-party-for-daughter-true-at-37-million-mansion.html><span>←</span><span>Khloe Kardashian Throws Party For Daughter True At $37 Million Mansion</span></a>
