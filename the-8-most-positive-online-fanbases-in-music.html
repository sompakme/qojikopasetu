Before the days of Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, and Facebook, the only ways fans could reach out to their favorite artist was by writing a letter, and the only way to meet other fans was to attend a concert or other organized event. Now, all fans have to do is send out a tweet about their favorite artist and hundreds (or even thousands) of other people can see that tweet and send their own reply.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, social media can also be a breeding ground for bullying, harassment, and just generally unpleasant behavior. It's a lot easier to make a snide remark when you're hiding behind your computer screen than it would be to make that same mean comment to someone's face. Because of this, online fandoms sometimes get a bad rap for being "toxic" – a word which the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as "<a href=#>extremely harsh, malicious, or harmful.</a>" The Bachelor fandom, for instance, has developed <a href=#>a reputation for being toxic</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Ariana Grande Dragged For Trademarking 'Ariana Army' As Her Fanbase Name">Ariana Grande Dragged For Trademarking 'Ariana Army' As Her Fanbase Name</a></span></p><p>With the ever-increasing importance of online fandoms, and the prevalence of toxicity within these fandoms, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WordTips</a> wanted to find out who the kindest and most positive online fan-bases were. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is what they found</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-wordtips-methodology><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>The WordTips Methodology</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/WordTips-positive-online-fandoms.jpg><p>According to the study from WordTips, they "conducted a sentiment analysis study to identify the negative and positive words used by 186 of Twitter’s most passionate fanbases." To find the fanbases, they "curated a long list of fanbases and their idols from sources, including <strong>USA Today</strong>, <strong>Newsweek, Forbes</strong>, and <strong>Business Insider</strong>, identifying one Twitter account representing each idol. Using Twitter API, [they] found 1,000 tweets from at least 100 unique followers of each of these accounts and analyzed tweets using the NRC lexicon to find out the percentage of positive and negative words. [They] then ranked the fanbases by the number of positive or negative words per 1,000 words used."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-sheeran-and-his-quot-sheerios-quot><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ed Sheeran And His "Sheerios"</span></h2><p>Ed Sheeran's fans – who call themselves "Sheerios" – come in as the eighth most positive online fandom according to the WordTips study.

These days, the term "army" is most often associated with BTS fans, but Shawn Mendes's fans use the term too, and Mendes once even joked that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the BTS Army "stole" the name from his fans</a>. He was quick to clarify that he was only goofing around, and that he was happy to share the term "army" with BTS.</p><p>WordTips found that Shawn Mendes's fans use 307 positive words in every 1000 total words, which makes his fans the fifth most positive online fandom in music according to the study.</p><h2 id=zayn-malik-and-his-quot-zquad-quot><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Zayn Malik And His "Zquad"</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Zayn Malik's fans – who call themselves the "Zquad" – come in as the fourth most positive online fandom according to the WordTips study.

WordTips found that Directioners use 322 positive words in every 1000 total words, making them the most positive online fandom in music according to the study.</p><p>It is important to remember, however, that this is just one study and that it uses a very particular methodology. "Positive" is a subjective term, and so there will never and can never be one conclusive way to truly determine the most positive fandoms. Furthermore, no fandom is a singular entity. Every fandom is made up of a unique collection of individuals who have different personalities, opinions, and methods of communication. In addition, WordTips is also very clear that "no fanbase is 100% good or evil" and that "a fanbase is definitely no reflection on the artist... that they stan."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thus, while these results are fascinating, they are not the be all end all.
