If you've already seen it, you know this cast is absolutely insane, and we're not even sure who the most star-studded cast member is.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Pictures Of Actors And The Real-Life People They Portrayed</a></span></p><p>We love every actor and actress involved in this project, and each of them brings so much talent to the table. However, have you ever wondered which of these celebrities actually earns the most from their careers? Well, you no longer have to, because here is the cast of <a href=#>Bombshell </a>and their net worth (according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=mark-duplass---3-million>Mark Duplass - $3 Million</h2><p>Mark Duplass plays Doug Brunt in this new biography drama. However, he's certainly no newbie to the big screen. He's definitely more of a television actor, and actually had a recurring role in the new Apple TV series,&nbsp;The Morning Show.&nbsp;You might also recognize this man's voice from&nbsp;<a href=#>Big Mouth</a>&nbsp;(as Val Bilzerian), or his face from&nbsp;Goliath&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Mindy Project.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obviously, all of these shows earned him a pretty penny. If you loved him in this drama, you should check out his shows, or tune into his most recent flicks, including&nbsp;Tully&nbsp;(also with Charlize Theron)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Paddleton.</p><h2 id=stephen-root---6-million>Stephen Root - $6 Million</h2><p>This man might not be at the forefront of your mind, but he has over 200 acting credits to his name. Yeah, you read that right. He plays Neil Mullen in&nbsp;Bombshell,&nbsp;but this man is pretty well-known for having some minor roles in a ton of blockbusters and shows.</p><p>In fact, he had a recurring role in the new television series,&nbsp;The Man in the High Castle.&nbsp;He's actually had A LOT of television roles, so we'll leave you to Google. The bottom line is this dude is no newbie, and we're surprised he's only the second-lowest on this list.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Highest-Grossing Margot Robbie Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-mckinnon---8-million>Kate McKinnon - $8 Million</h2><p>Kate McKinnon is hilarious, and we know that you love her on and off the screen. Most recently, she's been breaking the internet on <a href=#>SNL</a> where she most famously does skits of Hillary Clinton and Kellyanne Conway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Otherwise, she still has a ton of movie roles and television characters that have contributed to that $8 million net worth. We know she has more to come, and we honestly love everything this bombshell has to offer. She plays Jess Carr in this flick, but we also suggest binging all of her comedy flicks.</p><h2 id=connie-britton---8-million>Connie Britton - $8 Million</h2><p>Connie Britton plays Beth Ailes in this drama, but she also has made quite the name for herself in Hollywood. Most recently, she played Ally on the series&nbsp;SMILF,&nbsp;and she also had a recurring role in&nbsp;Dirty John, <a href=#>American Horror Story</a>, Nashville&nbsp;and&nbsp;9-1-1.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, she's most recently been working in television, but she definitely has her fair share of film credits. This gal has 2 Golden Globe nominations for television, though, so if you loved her, we suggest checking out the small screen.</p><h2 id=allison-janney---14-million>Allison Janney - $14 Million</h2><p>Allison Janney is hilarious, and if that wasn't enough, she's actually an Academy Award-winning actress. If you haven't seen&nbsp;I, Tonya&nbsp;(where she also stars alongside Margot Robbie), we suggest getting on it immediately. You probably also know this talented gal from&nbsp;The Help, Juno,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hairspray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;She plays Susan Estrich in&nbsp;Bombshell,&nbsp;and she even has four more movies in production now. Honestly though, this gal's most iconic (and recent) role is definitely as Bonnie on the television series&nbsp;Mom.&nbsp;These all certainly contributed to that net worth, and we're sure it's far from its peak.</p><p>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Movies To Watch If You Like Bombshell</a></p><h2 id=margot-robbie---22-million>Margot Robbie - $22 Million</h2><p>Margot Robbie has certainly stolen our hearts in the last few years. You probably know her best as <a href=#>Harley Quinn</a> from&nbsp;<a href=#>Suicide Squad</a>,&nbsp;where she certainly exploded in Hollywood. However, that's definitely not her most critically-acclaimed film, and she actually received an Oscar nomination for&nbsp;I, Tonya.&nbsp;</p><p>However, her most famous roles are probably from&nbsp;The Wolf of Wall Street, The Legend of Tarzan,&nbsp;and most recently she starred in Quentin Tarantino's new flick,&nbsp;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.&nbsp;Margot has all the boxes checked, and while she's already worth $22 million, we know that will likely rise exponentially pretty soon (she has 8 projects on the go right now).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-lithgow---45-million>John Lithgow - $45 Million</h2><p>Most recently, this man played the iconic Winston Churchill in the television series&nbsp;<a href=#>The Crown</a>, but we know that this veteran actor was famous long before that. He has over 100 acting credits and has 2 Oscar nominations to show for it. He plays Roger Ailes in&nbsp;Bombshell,&nbsp;but this actor can play the hero or the villain.</p><p>He's brilliant, and honestly, a Hollywood legend. We're not surprised his net worth is what it is, and we can't even begin to list his best flicks. However, we do suggest checking out all of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Once Upon a Time In Hollywood Cast, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=malcolm-mcdowell---70-million>Malcolm McDowell - $70 Million</h2><p>This is another actor that might slip off your radar, but has literally almost 300 acting credits to show for his long career. He's been acting since the mid-'60s, so his role as Rupert Murdoch in this drama certainly wasn't his first.</p><p>Most recently, he's done some television and film, but you probably know him best from&nbsp;A Clockwork Orange,&nbsp;Star Trek Generations,&nbsp;or&nbsp;Halloween.&nbsp;He has a lot of stuff, and he also has several movies on the go. Seriously, $70 is a lot, but he's done A LOT.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=charlize-theron---160-million>Charlize Theron - $160 Million</h2><p>Charlize Theron is unrecognizable in this movie as Megyn Kelly, but she absolutely slays the role. This actress is incredibly versatile, and she even won an Academy Award for&nbsp;Monster,&nbsp;and also snagged a nomination for&nbsp;North Country.&nbsp;</p><p>However, most recently she killed it in&nbsp;Long Shot, The Fate of the Furious, Tully,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Atomic Blonde.&nbsp;She's iconic, to say the least, and she's also gotten into producing, which likely also contributes to a lot of her impressive net worth. It's not shocking that she takes the silver medal with a net worth of $160 million.</p><h2 id=nicole-kidman---250-million>Nicole Kidman - $250 Million</h2><p>It's likely not shocking that this talented, beautiful, and versatile woman takes the #1 spot on this list. She's a legend in Hollywood, and we're sure everyone knows her name. Most recently, we've definitely fallen in love with Nicole as Celeste Wright in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Little Lies</a>,&nbsp;which she even won a Golden Globe for. S</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>he actually has three Oscar nominations and also won in 2003 for&nbsp;The Hours.&nbsp;This actress is a straight bombshell, and we mean that in all senses (and pun included). She slayed as Gretchen Carlson, but we know she has so much more to come. She has certainly earned her $250 million, and we can only assume that this is far from the end of her impressive career.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Nicole Kidman Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8GopJurmJq5rXnMmqCnZZOWwLV5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sherry-schmidt-obituary-mma-fighter-dies-in-a-car-accident.html><span>←</span><span>Sherry Schmidt Obituary MMA Fighter Dies In A Car Accident</span></a>
