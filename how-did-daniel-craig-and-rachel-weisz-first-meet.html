For example, there have been times in which two stars got together and the world seemingly couldn't look away since they seemed like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">polar opposites</a> from one another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unlike some of the celebrity couples who garner a lot of attention these days, it often seems like people ignore the fact that Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig are married. Together for many years at this point, in a lot of ways, it is quite surprising that the press doesn’t seem to care about Craig and Weisz’s relationship. For example, both of them are gorgeous human beings and while that is purely superficial, people like to watch the lives of beautiful people.</p><p>Due to the fact that Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz’s marriage doesn’t get talked about that often, it makes sense that a lot of people know very little about their relationship. If you are looking for proof of that, look no further than the fact that there are a lot of misconceptions about how Weisz and Craig actually met in the first place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celebrity Couples With Disturbing Age Gaps</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-exactly-a-meet-cute>Not Exactly A Meet-Cute</h2><p>After many years of movies convincing some people that the best couples come into contact for the first time in some kind of adorable way, some folks want to have their real-life meet-cute. However, in reality, the vast majority of couples meet each other in some kind of mundane way. For example, these days it certainly seems like everyone meets their significant others online, and while that makes a lot of sense, it doesn’t result in a captivating story.</p><p>In the case of Daniel Craig And Rachel Weisz, they seem to be wonderful together but the story of the first time they met isn’t exactly a dream come true.</p><p>Long before Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig had both became <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rich and famous</a>, they were just a couple of actors trying to find their big break. After both actors found work for the first time in 1992, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they met</a> when each of them were cast in a theater production of Les Grandes Horizontales in 1994. In the years that followed their introduction, Weisz and Craig remained friends but it wasn’t until many years later that they would become something more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Did Olivia Wilde And Jason Sudeikis Meet?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-intervening-years>The Intervening Years</h2><p>In the years after Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz met for the first time, both of them got involved with other people. In the case of Rachel Weisz, she met and fell for the famous director Darren Aronofsky in 2001, they got engaged in 2005, had a child together, and then split in 2010.</p><p>When it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daniel Craig’s love life</a>, he’d already been married when he met Rachel Weisz for the first time. After walking down the aisle with an actor named Fiona Loudon in 1992, she gave birth to the future Bond’s baby, and then they got divorced in 1994. From there, Craig briefly dated the German actor Heike Makatsch and then got involved with a film producer named Satsuki Mitchell for many years.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Celeb Couples Who Met In The Most Unusual Ways</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=controversy-coming-together-and-lasting>Controversy, Coming Together, And Lasting</h2><p>According to reports, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz became a couple for their first time while working on a film together called Dream House in 2010. Unfortunately, based on the publically available information, Craig wasn’t a single man when he got involved with Weisz for the first time. Instead, according to reports, Craig was engaged to Satsuki Mitchell at the time, and instead of breaking up with her, he just stopped coming home. According to that same reports, Mitchell was seriously mad so she spent a fortune on Craig’s credit card.</p><p>In addition to that story, Daniel Craig had also reportedly been involved with Sienna Miller before he began dating Rachel Weisz even though she was engaged to Jude Law at the time. Miller and Craig stepping out actually led to serious litigation as their relationship was discovered when a journalist hacked into Sienna’s phone. Since that was a serious violation, the reporter was sued and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jude Law even testified</a> in court about confronting Craig due to his dalliance with Miller.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the circumstances of Daniel Craig’s life when he got romantically involved with Rachel Weisz the first time, their relationship has certainly gone the distance. Together ever since, Weisz and Craig got married in an intimate ceremony that was only attended by each of their children from their previous relationships and a couple of friends. Seven years later, Craig and Weisz’s family got bigger when they welcomed their daughter into the world. From all accounts, Daniel and Rachel remain happy together to this day.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What Daniel Craig's Ex-Wife Did When She Found Out About Rachel Weisz</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecOapaKdnGKws63IoGSappRiv6Kvx56jZq%2BVnsC7ecWiqaysXaKypsCO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./honey-bunchies-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html><span>←</span><span>Honey Bunchies Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth, and Investment</span></a>
