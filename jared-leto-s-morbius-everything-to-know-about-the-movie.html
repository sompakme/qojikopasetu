They’ve been realized before. So, that was really exciting to start from scratch.”</p><p>Though Morbius first appeared in an issue of The Amazing Spider-Man in 1971, the character has never made an appearance on the big screen. <strong>Stephen Norrington</strong>, who directed 1998’s Blade, played Morbius in a cameo role in that film, but the scene was ultimately cut from the movie. When <strong>Guillermo del Toro</strong> directed Blade II in 2002, he did not have the rights to use the character.</p><p></p><p>Leto <a href=#>previously played the Joker</a> in 2016’s Suicide Squad, but as fans know, the Batman supervillain has appeared on screen many times before. <a href=#>Heath Ledger</a> and <a href=#><strong>Joaquin Phoenix</strong></a> both won Oscars for their portrayals of the characters in 2008’s The Dark Knight and 2019’s Joker, respectively.</p><p>The 30 Seconds to Mars singer’s interpretation of the character was controversial with viewers and critics, but Leto now looks back on his time as the Joker with fondness. “That role was an opportunity of a lifetime,” he told <a href=#>Variety</a> earlier this month. “And I got a chance to do it twice.” (He reprised the role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League, which was released in 2021.)</p><p>Morbius is a Marvel Comics character, but the movie is not part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy and more. Instead, the events of the film take place in the same parallel universe that provides the setting for <a href=#><strong>Tom Hardy</strong></a>‘s Venom and Venom: Let There Be Carnage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Leto, for his part, still hopes he gets to encounter <a href=#><strong>Tom Holland</strong></a>‘s Spider-Man in a future film, despite the fact that Morbius exists in a different universe. “I think Tom Holland and I have a date with destiny,” he told Screen Rant. “It would be great to get in the ring with him and go head-to-head, for sure.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for everything to know about Morbius.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BfrrOxw2ajnqyfqHquu9GboK6rXZrDpr7YrZ%2BippdiwbB5yqemsGWRl7y2wIytn55lnaTDqrGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hollywood-s-15-worst-kissers-as-revealed-by-their-co-stars.html><span>←</span><span>Hollywoods 15 Worst Kissers As Revealed By Their Co-Stars</span></a>
