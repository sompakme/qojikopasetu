Remy, born&nbsp;Reminisce Smith, was previously charged on four counts of misdemeanor assault and harassment for the April 16 incident.</p><p>A few factors played into the case being thrown out. One was a credible witness who was with Remy the night of the incident. The witness said she never saw Remy interact with Taylor. Meanwhile, Taylor’s witness who backed up her accusation stopped cooperating with investigators.</p><p>One of the biggest factors in the loose case was a private group chat going public that showed Taylor accusing Remy’s husband Papoose of hitting her.&nbsp;“Papoose is a b***h for toching [sic] me and he’s a b***h for making his wife take the wrap [sic] for it! SMFH!!! N***REALLY KNOCKED ME OUT BRO! S**T MAKING ME SICK TO MY SOUL,” she allegedly said.&nbsp;Taylor claimed she had video proof but it never made it to the courtroom.</p><p>“I’m just happy that it’s over,” Remy told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">reporters</a>. “I wish they would have come to this conclusion before I had an ankle bracelet and lost months and months of wages.”</p><p>Remy’s lawyer, Dawn Florio, said that she was also pleased with the outcome.“Remy Smith has always maintained her complete innocence as she never laid a hand on her celebrity-obsessed, clout-chasing, credibility-challenged accuser,” the attorney said.</p><p>Remy is now working on her upcoming album Reminisce&nbsp;and supporting bossman Fat Joe with the release of his new album Family Ties, dropping Friday (Dec. 6). Taylor has remained mum on the case but did post to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> the need for new management.</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://share.tmz.com/videos/120219-remy-ma-4685936-0-quhp1rwe/</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5bAtK3Upatmm5iWv6ix0maYoJmZo8C1edGepLJlnZZ6pb7OqaeenF2ZsrWtyKWqZm5nZYB3fY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paula-deen-s-weight-loss-encouraged-her-to-join-dancing-with-the-stars.html><span>←</span><span>Paula Deen's Weight Loss Encouraged Her to Join Dancing With the Stars</span></a>
