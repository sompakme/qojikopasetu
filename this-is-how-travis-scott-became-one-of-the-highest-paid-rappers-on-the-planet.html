The music industry reeks of his success, and he has smashed records with his hits at a rate that makes it difficult to track. When it comes to success, he's tasted it, and with an estimated net worth of well over $50 million, when it comes to wealth, he has certainly earned it. Sitting atop a list of the rap world's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most elite earners</a>, Scott is only 30 years old, but at this very young age, he has already demonstrated that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his entrepreneurial skills</a> are as razor sharp as his lyrics are, and he's padding his income with more deals and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">endorsement campaigns</a> than fans can count.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-scott-dominates-the-rap-scene>Travis Scott Dominates The Rap Scene</h2><p>Travis Scott doesn't just rap, he spits lyrics that evoke emotion from his fans, so much so, that his concerts are famed for being intense mosh pits that last throughout the entire duration of his performances.&nbsp; In May of 2017 his fans were so heavily immersed in his music and the subsequent mosh pit that formed during his Arkansas concert, that Scott was arrested and charged with inciting a riot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His music moves people, and motivates them to keep streaming his music. As the cash rolls in, Scott sees the direct result of his success in his bank account. The more the accolades pour in, the more money is deposited in his account. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes, </a>"In 2015, he released his first record, Rodeo, which peaked at No. 2 on Billboard’s top-albums chart and eventually went platinum.... a&nbsp;year later, he pumped out another LP, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. It too rose to the top of the Billboard chart and went platinum."&nbsp; He hasn't looked back since then.</p><p>Travis Scott's skills far surpass his ability to engage his fans on the stage or through is recorded music. He also happens to be an incredible producer, as well. Celebrity Net Worth reports that; "he was executive producer on Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music label's compilation album Cruel Winter. Scott has also produced songs and albums for artists such as Kanye West, Jay-Z, Trinidad James, Big Sean, John Legend, Drake, and Madonna. He produced the hit single Bitch Better Have My Money&nbsp;by Rihanna."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Touring also plays a huge role in depositing big bucks into Travis Scott's bank account. All his tours have been wildly successful, with the Astroworld Tour in 2019 grossing a jaw-dropping $60 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis Scott Teases Collaboration With Nike For Limited-Edition Sneakers</a></span></p><h2 id=mcdonalds-and-cactus-jack>McDonalds And Cactus Jack</h2><p>Among the numerous deals that Scott has in place with various brands is one very lucrative arrangement he has with the biggest fast food chain in popular culture, McDonalds. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a> reports that Scott <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">partnered up with McDonald's </a>to create the $6 Travis Scott meal&nbsp;, which consisted of "a Quarter Pounder with cheese, bacon, and lettuce, and medium fries with BBQ Sauce, and a Sprite."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then went on to&nbsp;bulk up the fashion sales of his very own label, Cactus Jack, with McDonald's inspired merchandise. The collection included branded shorts that cost $250 and a $90 body pillow that was designed in the shape of a chicken nugget. Of course, Scott was also paid handsomely for appearing in a commercial that advertised&nbsp;for McDonalds.</p><h2 id=fortnite-and-general-mills>Fortnite and General Mills</h2><p>The brilliantly business-minded Travis Scott knows better than to be brand-loyal to any singular organization. Instead, he has accumulated a huge umbrella of brand endorsement deals that keep generating insane amounts of profit for the young rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His affiliation with Fortnite and General Mills definitely attribute to a good portion of his wealth. In 2020, Travis Scott held a virtual concert series within the video game, Fortnite, and more than 12 million viewers tuned in on the first night, alone. He sold well over $2.5 million in merchandise from that virtual appearance, and ended up attracting well over 27 million viewers over the course of the 3-day online event.</p><p>General Mills also proved to be a lucrative deal for Scott.&nbsp;In 2019, he collaborated with General Mills to create $50 limited edition custom boxes for Reeses Puffs, and they completely sold out in 30 seconds.</p><h2 id=fashion-forward>Fashion Forward</h2><p>Aside from the money generated by music and food-related brands, Travis Scott also has his hand in the fashion industry in a very big way, and we're not just referencing Cactus Jack merchandise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Travis Scott also worked alongside famed designer Helmut Lang in 2015, creating a 19-piece capsule collection of some very pricey casual gear.</p><p>Of course, he didn't stop there, as he needed shoes to complete the outfit.</p><p>Travis Scott has a wildly lucrative deal in place with Nike, which saw the reproduction of some of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike's most iconic shoes</a>. In addition to this, he also struck a deal with the Houston Astros by designing a limited edition baseball cap.</p><p>Tavis Scott has also starred in a stunning advertising campaign for Saint Laurent's Spring/Summer 2019 collection, deepening his relationships with those in the world of fashion.</p><h2 id=perpetual-motion>Perpetual Motion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it's clear that Travis Scott has absolutely already achieved incredibly high levels of fame and fortune, it's clear that he is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reveals that; "between September 2017 and September 2018, Travis earned $20 million between touring, record sales and his Nike endorsement deal. That was enough to make him one of the 15 highest-paid rappers on the planet for the year."</p><p>Now, as he embarks on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an adventure with Kylie Jenner</a>, becoming the father of a 2nd child with her, Travis Scott has further deepened his relationship with the Kardashian-Jenner family. This inevitably means all eyes are on him once again, as he sets forth on another mission designed to stun his fans and pad his bank account even more.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Nas X Takes On Executive Role At Taco Bell</a></span></p><p>Sources:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Insider</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBs63Voqpmq5OkwbV5x6KeoZ2jqXqxrcidZKuZoKWys3s%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nikita-kucherov-is-married-to-wife-anastasiya-kuchevora-kids-max.html><span>←</span><span>Nikita Kucherov is Married to Wife: Anastasiya Kuchevora.
