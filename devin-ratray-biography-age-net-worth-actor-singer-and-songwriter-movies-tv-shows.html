This role was continued in 1992 in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, where the McCallister family journeys from Miami to New York City to find their troublesome youngest member.</p><p>He landed on minor roles in Little Monsters (as Ronnie Coleman, the bully), Dennis the Menace (as Mickey, the boyfriend of one of Dennis’s babysitters) and an episode as Martin in The Enforcers (1996). Another film role was The Prince and Me as the computer-obsessed roommate of “Eddy,” the royal Prince of Denmark.</p><p>He was a regular improvasy actor on MTV’s Damage Control, notably as a director of an erotic film called Crazy Motor Hos, in which he was dressed as a naval captain. He appeared in the September 29, 2006 episode of Law & Order, “Avatar”, as the mentally ill murderer Richard Elam. He later portrayed an antagonist in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. He was a lisping doctor in the movie Slippery Slope (2006). He performed as Jimmy Link in Serial (2007). He appeared in the 2009 film Surrogates as Bobby Saunders. Variety said, “he gets good mileage out of his role as a computer whiz too proud of his corpulent geekiness to consider a more glamorous substitute.” In 2009, he was also a guest star on the fifth season of Supernatural in the episode “The Real Ghost Busters”.</p><p>In late 2007, a documentary film crew followed Ratray’s attempts to win the heart of US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He used ‘love disks’ love letters set to music and images to serenade her, and traveled from New York to Alabama, Denver, Palo Alto, and Washington DC to court her. The resulting film, Courting Condi, was due for international release in fall 2008. He has appeared as a contestant on the game show Cash Cab and subsequently lost. In 2012, he played a mutual funds manager trapped in a Wall Street elevator with eight strangers, in the suspense thriller Elevator. He also played Cole in the 2013 film Nebraska, Ben Gaffney in the 2013 film Blue Ruin and made an appearance in the 2013 film R.I.P.D.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=devin-ratray-song></span><span>Devin Ratray Song</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=devin-ratray-movies></span><span>Devin Ratray Movies</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Where Are the Children?&nbsp;(1986) as Neil Keeney</li><li>If It’s Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium&nbsp;(1987) (Television film)</li><li>The River Pirates&nbsp;(1988) as Bubba</li><li>Zits&nbsp;(1988) as Oscar Opily</li><li>Little Monsters&nbsp;(1989) as Ronnie Coleman</li><li>Worth Winning&nbsp;(1989) as Howard Larimore Jr</li><li>Home Alone&nbsp;(1990) as Buzz McCallister</li><li>Perfect Harmony&nbsp;(1991) (Television film) as Shelby</li><li>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&nbsp;(1992) as Buzz McCallister</li><li>Dennis the Menace&nbsp;(1993) as Mickey</li><li>Strong Island Boys&nbsp;(1997) as Cal</li><li>The Bill&nbsp;(2001) (Short film) as Thug</li><li>The Prince and Me&nbsp;(2004) as Scotty</li><li>Slippery Slope&nbsp;(2006) as Hospital Assistant</li><li>Serial&nbsp;(2007) as Jimmy Link</li></ul><ul><li>The Cake Eaters&nbsp;(2007) as JJ</li><li>The 2 Bobs&nbsp;(2009) as Horizontal Bob</li><li>The Winning Season&nbsp;(2009) as Security Officer</li><li>Surrogates&nbsp;(2009) as Bobby</li><li>The Flying Scissors&nbsp;(2009) as The Rock</li><li>Breaking Point&nbsp;(2009) as Kevin</li><li>Odd Jobs&nbsp;(2010) (Television film) as Joe Bannon</li><li>Elevator&nbsp;(2011) as Martin Gosling</li><li>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit&nbsp;(2011) as Eldon Balogh [Episode: “Possessed”]</li><li>Construction&nbsp;(2012) as Ray</li><li>The Good Wife&nbsp;(2012) “Two Girls, One Code” as Kevin Costas</li><li>Side Effects&nbsp;(2013) as Banks patient #3</li><li>Blue Ruin&nbsp;(2013) as Ben Gaffney</li></ul><ul><li>Nebraska&nbsp;(2013) as Cole</li><li>R.I.P.D.&nbsp;(2013) as Pulaski</li><li>Elementary&nbsp;(2015) “The View From Olympus” as Gordon Meadows&nbsp;[2]</li><li>Agent Carter&nbsp;(2015) as Sheldon McFee</li><li>Louie&nbsp;(2015) as Mike</li><li>3rd Street Blackout&nbsp;(2015) as Adam Daddario</li><li>The Lennon Report&nbsp;(2016) as Phil Bernstein</li><li>Masterminds&nbsp;(2016) as Runny</li><li>Rough Night&nbsp;(2017) as Bud</li><li>Mosaic&nbsp;(2017/2018) as Detective Nate Henry</li><li>The Tick&nbsp;(2017/2018) as Tinfoil Kevin</li><li>Hawaii Five-0&nbsp;(2018) as Harris Stubman</li><li>The Good Fight&nbsp;(2018) as Kevin Costas</li><li>Chicago Med&nbsp;(2018) as Tommy Burke</li><li>Russian Doll&nbsp;(2019) as Deli Customer</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=devin-ratray-tv-shows></span><span>Devin Ratray Tv Shows</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Mosaic (murder mystery) 2018</li><li>Supernatural 2005</li><li>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit 1999</li><li>The good wife 2009-2016</li><li>Damage Control (TV series) 2005</li><li>Law & Order 1990-2010</li><li>Person of Interest 2011-2016</li><li>Heartland (1989 TV series) 1989</li><li>Law and Order: Criminal Intent 2001-2011</li><li>Third Watch 1999-2005</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=devin-ratray-instagram></span><span>Devin Ratray Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=devin-ratray-youtube-interview></span><span>Devin Ratray Youtube Interview</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fmbK3tc1mqZqsopbGbq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5kp52kYsSwvtOhZJqbpKS%2Fbr%2FIp56eql2Wu6V50qiloK%2BinsGmvoympq%2Bhlah6tcKMrJ%2Bor6Nk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chrissy-lampkin-net-worth-therichest.html><span>←</span><span>Chrissy Lampkin Net Worth | TheRichest</span></a>
