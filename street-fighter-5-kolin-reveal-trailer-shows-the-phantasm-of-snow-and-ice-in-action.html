Or Helen, if you prefer.</p><p>As promised, her reveal was accompanied by the debut of a new Lupe Fiasco track, It's Not by Design, from the forthcoming album, Drogas Light.</p><p>Kolin, described as the "Phantasm of Snow and Ice", has featured in the series as an NPC in Street Fighter 3 before going under cover as Helen in Street Fighter 5, appearing in the story. Now she's decided to join the roster and whoop some ass.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Here's Kolin's back story and move details, direct from <a href=#>Capcom Unity</a>. Some spoilers for Street Fighter 5 in the italics.</p><p>After working in the shadows for Gill and the secret Illuminati organization, Kolin makes her Street Fighter 5 debut. First appearing in Street Fighter 3, Kolin works behind the scenes in order to fulfill the Prophecy of Miraha and stop any who dare stand in Gill’s way. She is typically calm and collected, but can suddenly fly into a rage when anybody threatens Gill and his plans. Spoiler-alert, she resurrects Nash and uses him as a pawn too, showing she will do anything to achieve her goals.</p><p>Kolin excels in the Russian martial art of Systema, utilizing the opponent’s momentum against them and executing various slash-like attacks and knife hand strikes. Gill has bestowed upon her the power of ice, allowing her to augment her fight style with frigid blasts and deadly icicles. She is often heard speaking condescendingly towards her opponents, knowing they don’t stand a chance before her, let alone Gill. Where did her hatred of Shadaloo come from and how did she originally become involved with Gill?</p><ul><li><strong>V-Skill:</strong> Inside Slash<br>Kolin’s unique counter allows her to deflect and automatically punish incoming moves with ease.</li><li><strong>V-Trigger:</strong> Diamond Dust<br>With a full V-meter, Kolin can slam the ground twice with her foot, each time shooting out a path of sharp icicles across the floor. In addition to damage and stun, this move freezes the opponent’s stun gauge. While in this special state, the stun gauge will not deplete and if Kolin is successful in stunning the opponent, they will be frozen in place.</li><li><strong>Critical Art:</strong> Frost Tower<br>Kolin dashes forward with a slice of her hand. If the attack connects, she’ll continue summoning large icicles from the ground, throwing the opponent into the air and shattering the ice to drop them to the ground.</li></ul><p>We also got a glimpse at her three alternate costumes, Story, Battle, and Street Fighter 3's Nostalgia. Check out some screens below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/asset.vg247.com/street_fighter_5_kolin_5.jpg/BROK/resize/690%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/street_fighter_5_kolin_5.jpg><p>Kolin will go live in Street Fighter 5 on February 28, complete with story and extra costumes. She's included in the Street Fighter 5 Season 2 Character Pass, which also includes Akuma and four more soon-to-be-announced characters, premium battle costumes with colours 3-10 unlocked, default costumes with colours 3-10 unlocked, and a PS4 theme where applicable.</p><p>Capcom said the rest of the Street Fighter 5 Season 2 Character Pass will be detailed "every other month beginning in February". In months when Capcom isn't talking about the Season pass, it will discuss balance changes and playuer feedback ahead of upcoming patches, including one it hopes to announce in March.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7ORbW5nm5%2BifLTA0Z6crWWWnrSpwMSrZG5lm6S5qrqMq5yvnZGherW%2BwKKjnqpdqLWww9Jmq6GdXaW1orrTmqqmZZ%2BberS6zrBkmqaUYraksYyipWaZk6m2sLo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephen-colbert-is-forever-a-taylor-swift-fan-following-the-artist-s-interaction-with-his-daughter.html><span>←</span><span>Stephen Colbert Is Forever A Taylor Swift Fan Following The Artist's Interaction With His Daughter</span></a>
