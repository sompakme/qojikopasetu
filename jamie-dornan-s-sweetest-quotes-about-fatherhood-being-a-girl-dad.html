It’s an extremely joyful situation and every day seems to get better,” he told Australia’s <a href=# rel=noopener>News.com.au</a> with a smile. “I know it’s my most important role in life.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>October 2018</b></h3><p class=p1>While Warner was pregnant with Alberta, Dornan told <i>Us </i>that he was “very, very excited” to meet his third baby.</p><p class=p1>“I’m just as excited as I was the first two times,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jamie-Dornan-Is-a-Proud-Girl-Dad-of-3-2.jpg><h3 class=p3><b>January 2022</b></h3><p class=p1>While Dornan loves his real-life family, he was initially wary about playing a dad on the big screen.</p><p class=p1>“In<i> Belfast</i>, I play a dad, and there was a moment when I read the script where I thought, I’m a young guy — I’m not ready to play a father,” he quipped to <a href=# rel=noopener><i>W </i>magazine</a>. “Mind you, in real life I do have a wife and three daughters, but my kids in <i>Belfast</i> are a bit older than my actual children. Then I realized that I was playing a version of [writer-director] Sir Kenneth Branagh’s dad, and I felt better. I also grew up in Belfast, and I wanted to make the city proud.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>March 2022</b></h3><p class=p1>Dornan gave Warner and their daughters a sweet shout-out on International Women’s Day.</p><p class=p1>“I’m nothing but a pile of dust without this crew. <span class=s1>💚</span>,” he wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, sharing a family photo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Jamie-Dornan-Is-a-Proud-Girl-Dad-of-3-1.jpg><h3 class=p3><b>January 2024</b></h3><p class=p1>“I want to be someone they feel they can trust and say anything to,” he told <i>The Sunday Times </i>of Dulcie, Elva and Alberta. “They seem to be very creative, cool, talented little people who are performers.

I don’t know any other way,” Dornan told <strong>Hoda Kotb</strong> and<strong> Jenna Bush Hager</strong>. “[I have] three girls, so I don’t know how I’d be as a boy dad or I’m not sure I could deal with the energy, I’m someone who has a lot of energy anyway and quite hyper often, so we wouldn’t cope with three hyper boys in the house.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>February 2024</b></h3><p class=p1>Dornan’s kids have become prone to getting embarrassed by his presence.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I’m in that sweet spot where they’re just starting to be embarrassed. … So, you lean into it quite a lot and make her even more embarrassed in a way,” he joked on <a href=# rel=noopener><i>Late Night With Seth Meyers</i></a>. “We’ll get through it.

Just put me in the second <i>Trolls </i>movie. I’ll walk on and I’ll sneeze, I don’t care.’”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajmZ2esm6wzqulmqajYsC4scStnKysXabCsMDErGSamp%2BqwW6ywK2fnqqYpLylecGeoKefXZZ6qLXRpWSdmZRk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./evelyn-penn-willis-bio-wiki-age-parents-emma-heming-bruce-willis-tallulah-belle-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Evelyn Penn Willis Bio, Wiki, Age, Parents, Emma Heming, Bruce Willis, Tallulah Belle and Net Worth</span></a>
