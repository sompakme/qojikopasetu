<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Drew Barrymore Won't Let Daughter Pose for Playboy: That's My Journey</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a> has no regrets over her very wild younger years, but that doesn't mean she wants her daughter to follow in her footsteps. In an interview with <a href=#>ABC News</a>' <strong>Amy Robach</strong>, the 38-year-old actress, who is six-months-pregnant with her second daughter, opens up about how motherhood has changed her.</p><p>"Is there anything you look back at [in your life] and you kind of cringe?" Robach asked.</p><p>"No. I celebrate that I had any sense of freedoms at a certain point, because I don't feel like that now," Barrymore said. "I love the very exposed, humorous, imperfect, never trying to pretend to be perfect journey that I have been on in my life."</p><p>The E.T. child star famously went to rehab at the age of 13 for alcohol and drug abuse. She later attempted suicide, and became emancipated from her parents at age 15. By 19, she posed for Playboy and got her first divorce from <strong>Jeremy Thomas</strong>. (Barrymore <a href=#>remains estranged</a> from mother <strong>Jaid Barrymore</strong>; father<strong> John Drew Barrymore</strong> died in 2004.)</p><p>Now, Barrymore is married to third husband <strong>Will Kopelman</strong>, and is the proud mother to daughter Olive, 15 months.</p><p>"What if Olive comes to you at 18 or 19 and says, 'Mom, I want to pose for Playboy?'" Robach asked.&nbsp;</p><p>"I would not let her," Barrymore said. "I don't think I would. I would influence her not to, because my life choices are not supposed to be the gateway to somebody else's. That's my journey."</p><p>"I have no regrets in my life whatsoever," the Big Miracle star explained. "I'm psyched about it all. I'm just in such a different mind frame. I'm in mom mode now."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The soon-to-be mother of two said she plans to be a good role model for her children moving forward.</p><p>"The best kind of parent you can be is to lead by example," Barrymore said. "Whatever I've experienced in my life is a part of my story, and I'm proud of that. But it's someone who wakes up early, works all day, believes in charitable work, business-minded, diligent, accountable, problem-solving . . . I'm so much about school, consistency and tradition."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGadqpWseqOt0auwpqeimnq4u82tZKWdpGKxosHGoaueql2lvLSxjJ%2Bmq2Wgoa66rs6yZK2gkanAbrnYZqGoraKjsrp5kWlobWpgZnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./david-beckham-is-gutted-after-u-k-storm-damages-his-family-home.html><span>←</span><span>David Beckham Is Gutted After U.K. Storm Damages His Family Home</span></a>
