Trebek quipped before the final clue, “Let’s look at the $1,000 clue … just for the fun of it.” After the question, he told the group: “If you guys ring in and get this one, I will die.” He then cut to commercial break, adding “I have to talk to them!”</p><p>The official Twitter account for the game show also tweeted out a video of the clip, writing, “Fun fact: Our contestants answered as many clues in this category as the @Browns had wins this season.” The Cleveland Browns lost 16 games in a row this season.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Trebek recently returned to Jeopardy after taking a brief leave following brain surgery. “Some of you may have heard by now that during the holiday break, I had a slight medical problem — a subdural hematoma, blood clots on the brain, caused by a fall I endured about two months ago,” he explained in a video on January 4. “Surgery was performed. After two days in the hospital, I came home to start recovery. Prognosis is excellent, and I expect to be back in the studio and taping more Jeopardy! programs very, very soon.”</p><p>Jeopardy!&nbsp;airs on ABC weeknights at 7 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK6arJOdequxzqmYq5ypYrCwutOeqq2ZnqnAbsPHqGSkpp%2Bseq%2B706Ggp59dlq%2BwwdNmnainpJeurbiO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./walt-disney-s-final-days-documented-in-autopsy-the-last-hours-of.html><span>←</span><span>Walt Disneys Final Days Documented in Autopsy: The Last Hours of</span></a>
