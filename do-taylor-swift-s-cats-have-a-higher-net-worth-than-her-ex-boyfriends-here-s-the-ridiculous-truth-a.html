This ranking is based on Instagram analytics, with many of the top-earning furry companions achieving wealth through their social media popularity.</p><p>Olivia, named after Mariska Hargitay's character in Law & Order, has starred alongside Swift in commercials. She even appeared with her big sister Meredith in an intermission video during Swift's 1989 World Tour in 2015.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-joe-alwyn-39-s-net-worth-compared-to-taylor-swift-39-s-cat-olivia-benson>How Much Is Joe Alwyn's Net Worth Compared To Taylor Swift's Cat, Olivia Benson?</h2><p>With an estimated net worth of $4 million, Joe Alwyn's career boasts of several critically acclaimed films, such as Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, Mary Queen of Scots, The Favourite, and Operation Finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has also starred in Hulu's Conversations with Friends and Lena Dunham's film Catherine Called Birdy. In addition to his on-screen talent, Alwyn is credited with several songs in "Folklore," for which he and Swift won a Grammy for Album of the Year in 2021.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1-36.jpg><p>Despite his success, Alwyn's net worth pales in comparison to that of Swift's beloved feline, Olivia, who is worth 24 times more than him. Olivia has made several appearances in Swift's music videos and ads for brands like Diet Coke and Keds shoes, which earned her a massive fortune.</p><p>According to All About Cats, Olivia has crafted her merchandise line and has had cameos in many high-budget ads, making her a successful feline entrepreneur.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-jake-gyllenhaal-39-s-net-worth-compared-to-taylor-swift-39-s-cat-olivia-benson>How Much Is Jake Gyllenhaal's Net Worth Compared To Taylor Swift's Cat, Olivia Benson?</h2><p>Jake Gyllenhaal has a net worth of $80 million as of 2023. The actor has made a name for himself as one of the industry's most versatile leading men.</p><p>While Gyllenhaal began acting as a child actor, he quickly transitioned to more central roles in theater and film, where he is best known for his roles in Brokeback Mountain, Nightcrawler, and Nocturnal Animals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template-1.jpg><p>Gyllenhaal's brief romance with Taylor Swift, which lasted only four months, left a lasting impact on the singer, who wrote two songs about him for her 2012 album "Red". <a href=#>Despite their relationship being known for the red scarf Swift mentioned in "All Too Well," Gyllenhaal admitted that the song was not about him.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Gyllenhaal's career achievements are impressive, he lags far behind Swift's cat, Olivia, in terms of net worth. Despite the heartbreak she experienced after her breakup with Gyllenhaal, Swift remains devoted to her feline companions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds Set Taylor Swift Up With Jake Gyllenhaal?</a></span></p><p>As a proud cat owner, Swift cherishes her cats. "Number one for me, the most influential factor in my life, is cats. I have cats. I'm obsessed with them," Swift revealed in a video for TIME.</p><p>Swift believes cats are dignified and independent creatures, capable of taking care of themselves. "Cats are just really cool. They're really great. They're very dignified. They're independent. They're very capable of dealing with their own life, and if you fit into that on that day, they'll make some time for you, maybe. I just really respect it," she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-john-mayer-39-s-net-worth-compared-to-taylor-swift-39-s-cat-olivia-benson>How Much Is John Mayer's Net Worth Compared To Taylor Swift's Cat, Olivia Benson?</h2><p>John Mayer is a prominent musician and songwriter who has made his mark on the music industry since the early 2000s. According to Celebrity Net Worth, he has amassed an estimated net worth of $70 million through his musical talent and songwriting prowess.</p><p>Mayer's relationship with Taylor Swift was brief, lasting only between 2009 and 2010 when she was 19, and he was 32. The ill-fated relationship and age gap became a sore point that inspired Swift's heartbreaking lyrics in the song "Dear John." The duo also collaborated on music while dating and later wrote scathing lyrics about each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/th-image-template.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Their past relationship came to light again when Swift released her track "Would've, Could've, Should've" on her Midnights album. Despite the intense media attention, Mayer has tried his best to avoid commenting on Taylor's music or album that references their past relationship.</p><p>However, news of Swift's split from Alwyn and the timing of Mayer's performance of "Paper Doll" on his April 8 show at Sacramento California, has once again resurrected the conversation about their past romance and the lyrics about one another that continues to live on.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Much Does Taylor Swift Actually Make On All Her Merchandise?</a></span></p><p>Although John Mayer made a sly jab at Taylor Swift, it cannot undermine the fact that Swift's cats have achieved more success than him. Swift's felines, Meredith Grey and Olivia have their merchandise line. In 2018, Swift filed a trademark for "Meredith and Olivia Swift" for various merchandise types.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to TMZ, Swift had plans to expand the cat merchandise line to include products such as pillows, handbags, musical recordings, jewelry, and more clothing. She even considered putting on a live show featuring Meredith and Olivia Swift, but it has yet to come to fruition.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-net-worth-of-taylor-swift-39-s-other-cats-meredith-grey-and-benjamin-button>What Is The Net Worth Of Taylor Swift's Other Cats, Meredith Grey And Benjamin Button?</h2><p>Taylor Swift's first famous cat is also a Scottish Fold named Meredith Grey. The feline was adopted in 2011 and named after the character from Grey's Anatomy. In 2021, fans expressed concern when Swift stopped posting photos of Meredith, but <a href=#>Swift reassured everyone that the cat was fine</a> and just doesn't like being in the spotlight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Taylor-Swift-holding-her-cats.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift's third cat, Benjamin Button, is named after Brad Pitt's character in the movie with the same title. He is a Ragdoll whom she adopted in 2019 after meeting for the first time on the set of her music video for "ME!" Benjamin starred alongside Meredith and Olivia in Swift's music video before being taken home by Swift.</p><p>Meredith and Benjamin do not have the same millionaire status as their sister, Olivia. According to Swift, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her other cats are "poor cats"</a> because Olivia is the only one with the most outgoing and sociable personality, thus, the reason why she can appear in commercials alongside Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina2rXZiutb%2BMoaCgoJWneq%2Bx02auqKqknXq1tMCnZJ6wXZe8urLRopynnKNit7CxjJqjsLGeZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./courtney-stodden-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Courtney Stodden News - Us Weekly</span></a>
