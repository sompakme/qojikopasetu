Owens is not only an acting teacher at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Herbert Berghof Studio</a> in New York but a consistently working actor.</p><p>He’s appeared&nbsp;on plenty&nbsp;of critically acclaimed series&nbsp;like&nbsp;Elementary, FX comedy It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia,&nbsp;HBO’s Divorce&nbsp;and Blue Bloods.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s also been the source of inspiration for fellow working actors.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Television images often times serve as our mirrors, showing us the good, the bad, the most possible versions of ourselves. The truth. As a child this man and the entire cast of The Cosby Show took me on a journey and allowed me to see a world outside of my own. As an adult having studied under this great human being, has been nothing short of amazing. Allowing me to dream, stretch, create, and be my truest most authentic artistic self. Thank you Geoffrey Owens for being an incredible teacher, mentor, and forever friend. You keep holding that mirror up and forcing me to see myself for who I truly am and I love you dearly for that. #actingclass101 #mentorship #geoffreyowens #dothework #craft</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kendra Holloway</a> (@kendra2shay) on Dec 6, 2017 at 11:25am PST</p><p>His upcoming projects include the film Impossible Monsters and the short film Fizzle.&nbsp;In addition to listing his accomplishments, fans called out the outlets for shaming the actor for having a “regular job.”</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Delete this.
