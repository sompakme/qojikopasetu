It’s a topic that has raised the eyebrows of many for quite some time. There’s been a long-standing rumor concerning celebrities, that suggests that almost everyone in Hollywood is either currently a swinger, or has been at one point. While this may or may not be true, it certainly makes many of your favorite celebrities just a little bit more exciting—or disgusting, depending on how you look at it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When it comes to committed relationships and marriages, mostly everyone knows that it can be a challenge to keep the romance alive. This can be especially true if you’ve been with someone for years and are constantly looking for ways to keep the connection especially interesting. Some people, famous or not, turn to swinging as a way to actually enhance their bond with each other. This seems counterproductive to many, but some of the couples who will actually admit that they’re swinging, say that it actually works for them.</p><p>Whether you’re a fan of relationships that include a little extracurricular activity, or you prefer to keep your relationships traditional and fully commit to your partner, you’ve got to admit that it’s at least a little interesting to see your favorite stars’ views on love and togetherness.&nbsp;Here are 10 celebrities who are rumored to be swingers.</p><h2 id=megan-fox>10. Megan Fox</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Model and actress <a href=#>Megan Fox</a> is 29, but she never quite got a chance to be wild in her teenage years, so she’s getting it out of her system now. She grew up in a very strict household, and wasn’t allowed to date while in high school. So, when she married <a href=#>Brian Austin Green</a>, chances are she got the chance to do some of the things that were never permitted when she was younger (namely, having sex). Green and Fox have two sons together, and it’s been rumored that Green is fine with his wife sleeping with other men. Maybe it’s her hotness that caused Brian to permit her to do whatever she wants. Other rumors say that the marriage is totally open, and that both Megan and Brian swing every once in a while.</p><p></p><h2 id=julia-louis-dreyfus>9. Julia Louis-Dreyfus</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There’s a rumor that’s been swirling for quite some time that <a href=#>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</a> and her husband <a href=#>Brad Hall</a>, are in an open relationship. However, it’s not clear whether Hall is allowed to sleep with other women, Julia is permitted to sleep with other men, or if both spouses are free to do as they please. Louis-Dreyfus is best known for her role as Elaine on the hit sitcom <i>Seinfeld</i>, and for her starring role on <i>The New Adventures of Old Christine</i>. Brad Hall is a writer, director and actor. He created the television series <i>Watching Elle</i> and <i>The Single Guy</i>. The pair were married in 1987 and met when they were both students at Northwestern University.</p><p></p><h2 id=will-smith>8. Will Smith</h2><p>Actor and rapper <a href=#>Will Smith</a> and his wife <a href=#>Jada Pinkett-Smith</a>, have been rumored to be swingers for years, even though Jada has denied this. Will stated at one point that he and his wife didn’t want to “stop what is natural,” and the two of them are going be attracted to other people at times. Smith said that if he or Jada wanted to have sex with someone else, they would be honest with each other about it. He claims that if one spouse doesn’t approve of the “swinging,” then the spouse who wanted to swing would have to call the whole thing off. Both Will and Jada have made it plain that they can’t watch each other all the time, and that their commitment to one another has to be a choice that they both make individually.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=justin-timberlake>7. Justin Timberlake</h2><p>After learning about the rumored relationship that singer and actor <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>, allegedly has with his wife, actress <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a>, it’s no wonder he played his role in the movie Friends With Benefits, so convincingly. Some people even thought that Timberlake was sleeping with his co-star <a href=#>Mila Kunis</a> in real life. The fact that Biel and Timberlake keep their relationship pretty private is another reason people suspect that they may not actually be the only two in the relationship. Before getting back with Biel, Justin Timberlake was in a relationship with <a href=#>Cameron Diaz</a>, who at one point, said that she didn’t believe in marriage. Diaz has since married former Good Charlotte band member <a href=#>Benji Madden</a>.</p><p></p><h2 id=bill-clinton>6. Bill Clinton</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No one can forget that huge sex scandal in the 1990s that involved then-President <a href=#>Bill Clinton</a>, and an intern named <a href=#>Monica Lewinsky</a>. Apparently, this wasn’t the first time that Clinton had “sexual relations” with another woman other than his wife, politician <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a>. One of Clinton’s mistresses Gennifer Flowers, asserted that Bill Clinton was a swinger. Flowers also stated that Hillary Clinton was a lesbian, which indicates that Mrs. Clinton was likely doing a little swinging of her own. Hilary has confirmed that she’ll be running for president of the United States in the 2016 election, so it’s likely that rumors like these will continue to surface as she campaigns.</p><p></p><h2 id=tilda-swinton>5. Tilda Swinton</h2><p>Statuesque British actor <a href=#>Tilda Swinton</a>, is known for her striking appearance and for her roles in artistic and science fiction films. Swinton is in a serious relationship with John Byrne, and the two have children together. However, she has also admitted to having a sexual relationship with Sandro Kopp, an artist. Tilda has expressed that the happiness of those she loves is what is most important, and asserted that different families have to do what works for them. While that’s true in theory, we can’t help but wonder how Swinton and Byrne are going to explain this to their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=pink>4. Pink</h2><p><a href=#>Pink</a> and her motorcycle racer husband <a href=#>Carey Hart</a>, were rumored to be in an open relationship for a short period of time; although some say that having sex with other people is no longer a part of the couple’s marriage. Apparently, both Pink and her husband became pretty jealous as a result of the arrangement. This is probably an indication that the two truly love each other. The two seem very happy together now, and are raising a young daughter named Willow.</p><p></p><h2 id=george-clooney>3. George Clooney</h2><p><a href=#>George Clooney</a> has long been known as one of the most sought-after bachelors in Hollywood. He was married once when he was younger, but vowed to never tie the knot again. He had a few high-profile relationships, including a romance with <a href=#>Stacy Keibler</a>. Then, Clooney surprised everyone when he married lawyer Amal Alamuddin, who specializes in criminal and international law. He has publicly expressed his love for her, and admitted that he didn’t think he would find love again. However, there are still some rumors flying around that suggest that Clooney is still a swinger. There are also reports that Amal wants to have a baby soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=angelina-jolie>2. Angelina Jolie</h2><p>It’s really not a surprise that many people think hot actress <a href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> is a swinger, even though she’s married to one of the most handsome actors in the world, <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>. Jolie has stated that she doesn’t think fidelity is a must for a relationship. She also said that just because she and Brad Pitt live together doesn’t mean they are “chained together,” and that they “never restrict each other.” This could easily be taken to mean that the two of them are free to sleep with whomever they choose. Of course, some people think that Jolie “stole” Brad Pitt away from his then-wife <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a>, so maybe she really doesn’t believe in fidelity.</p><p></p><h2 id=john-cusimano>1. John Cusimano</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John Cusimano is a lawyer and singer, as well as a producer for The Rachael Ray Show. After all, he is <a href=#>Ray’s</a> husband. While John is on the show often to help his famous wife make delicious dishes and cocktails, there’s also been talk that Cusimano has been cooking up a few other things around New York. Several reports indicate that he belongs to a swinger's club, and people who have allegedly seen him there mention that he doesn’t come with his wife. Rachael hasn’t exactly denied the rumors, but she did say that it upsets her family when people talk about John’s “lifestyle.”</p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=#>imdb.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>ranker.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>zap2it.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>madamenoire.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>huffingtonpost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnrCgmru0tdWeZKWhlprAtcXLnmZqaF2Ysq2xwaugraGVqHqzwcyoqZ6cXam8bq7EZqqwoZ6csrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-video-shows-blueface-attacking-chrisean-s-dad-after-getting-punch.html><span>←</span><span> New Video Shows Blueface Attacking Chrisean's Dad After Getting Punch</span></a>
