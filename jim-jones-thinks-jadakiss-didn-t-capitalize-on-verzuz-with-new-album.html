He could’ve just took eight records he had in the stash and just put them bit**es out, that bi**h was going platinum.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, adding “That was one thing I wish he would’ve did as me being a fan and me being a ni**a in the industry. Like, ‘Yo, man, it’s a moment, he’s supposed to go. Next day, single out, everything. I’m in the studio right now with Swizz tonight, like ni**a!’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">From Jones’ perspective, a new solo album from Jada would have been timely given <a href=#>the buzz surrounding the battle</a>. However, Kiss himself says he saw benefits from the increase in attention and exposure for himself and his groupmates.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“My numbers went up for hostings and walkthroughs, for shows, and TV cameos,” he said. “Just in general my numbers went up. It also showed Def Jam that they got to do the right thing [and] <a href=#>restructure my contract</a>. It really showed the world my true worth, what I can do.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Jim Jones speak about Jadakiss, their historic Verzuz battle and more below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B2rnnJqKWeq12frqWtyqKqrGWmmr%2B7wdlmpZ6vXZa5o8HMZmhra2RsgXl8kGpm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gina-mccarthy-wiki-biography-family-and-net-worth-10-facts-to-know.html><span>←</span><span>Gina McCarthy Wiki, Biography , Family And Net Worth: 10 Facts To Know</span></a>
