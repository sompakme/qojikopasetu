After <a href=#>an infamous car chase</a> in his white Ford Bronco that was broadcast on national TV, Simpson was ultimately arrested and taken into police custody outside his Brentwood, California, home.</p><p class=p1>Simpson was arraigned one month later, pleading not guilty to the charges. A trial officially began in January 1995, where Simpson notably hired a self-proclaimed “dream team” of defense attorneys, including <strong>Kris Jenner</strong>’s ex-husband <strong>Robert Kardashian Sr.</strong> (Jenner, meanwhile, was <a href=#>close friends with Brown Simpson</a> and sat with her family in the courtroom throughout the proceedings.)</p><p class=p1>Despite prosecutors <strong>Marcia Clark</strong> and<strong> Christopher Darden</strong>’s list of seemingly mounting evidence, a sequestered jury ultimately found Simpson not guilty of the two murders. Brown Simpson and Goldman’s families later sued Simpson for wrongful death in 1996, for which he was found liable. Simpson was ordered to pay the victims’ families $33 million in damages.</p><p class=p1>Simpson <a href=#>died 28 years later</a> in April 2024 after a battle with cancer at the age of 76.
