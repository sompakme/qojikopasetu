According to NY Daily News, Ryan Leslie is offering $1 million to anyone who will return his stolen Macbook to him. The singer made an initial offer of $20,000 when his laptop was stolen from inside a black Mercedes while on tour in Germany&nbsp;October 23. But as the days rolled sans his computer—and music— Leslie decided to up the dollar signs.
“For the record, I had so many amazing music & visual projects on that MacBook that I was working on to share with u this winter,” the singer tweeted to his more than 200,000 followers Saturday."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
