I don’t know if there is another public person whose <a href=# data-type=post data-id=306231>weight struggle has been exploited</a> as much as mine over the years. You all have watched me diet and diet and diet …. a recurring thing because my body always seems to want to go back to a certain weight.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Oprah then remembered times when she would go shopping for clothing and would be treated much different as someone overweight.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This is a world that has shamed people for being overweight forever,” Oprah said. “And all of us who’ve lived it know that <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234764809>people treat you differently,</a> they just do. It’s that thing where people are like, ‘Let me show you the gloves. Would you like to look at the handbags? Because we know that there’s nothing in here for you.’ There is a condescension. There is stigma.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, the OWN network creator spoke of ways she slimmed down, including her thoughts on the usage of the FDA-approved type 2 diabetes medication,&nbsp;Ozempic.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The drug works in the brain to impact satiety, and is the latest Hollywood weight loss trend,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>according to PEOPLE.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=# data-type=post data-id=382348>Weight Watchers stakeholder</a> also urged her viewers to love themselves no matter what body size they’re in — whilst admitting that she initially felt that if she took Ozempic, it was “an easy way out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Shouldn’t we all just be more accepting of whatever body you choose to be in? That should be your choice,” she said. “Even when I first started hearing about the weight loss drugs, at the same time I was going through knee surgery, and I felt, ‘I’ve got to do this on my own.’ Because if I take the drug, that’s the easy way out.'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Referring to no longer feeling ashamed of how she choses to lose weight, she added, “It should be yours to own and not to be shamed about it. As a person who’s been shamed for so many years, I’m just sick of it. I’m just sick of it. I’m just sick of it.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“And I hope this conversation begins the un-shaming.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6S9s63HZqmem5GhubR5zKKqraqVlsGusc2tZKygn6W9qrrGZmlpaF2hr7R5kGtqbW9pbH94f44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-may.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly May</span></a>
