It’s uninspired,’” host <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> said, while Lipa joked that many social media users said that she looked “like she’s trying to put her shoe on in a rush.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The singer continued, “There was a moment where it actually caused me a lot of grief, like, I was being bullied online. It wasn’t very nice.”</p><p>During the 2022 tour for her Grammy-winning sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, Lipa reclaimed the dance moves she had once been made fun of for by incorporating them into her performance — and making them better than ever.</p><p>“I can look at it from a different perspective,” the singer told Fallon, 49. “I look back at it with such fondness because it helped me grow into the artist that I wanted to become, it made me work harder.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuumV2htrGtjKucrKifo7G0edOoZK%2Bhopa5brDAp5qippdiuqa5xKxm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./20-times-wwe-superstars-relieved-themselves-during-a-match.html><span>←</span><span>20 Times WWE Superstars Relieved Themselves During A Match</span></a>
