Because we’ve been watching both of these actors on our screens since Season 1, we’ve already invested in them a little bit. We know who they are as people,” she said in 2022. “I feel like, especially in the last season, there are these moments of tension between them where it’s like, Colin walks up to the line of almost realizing that Penelope has feelings for him but doesn’t quite get there. Instead of treading water on that dynamic, we wanted to push it into their season. It really felt like the perfect moment to tee it up.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Coughlan, who previously starred in the British sitcom <i>Derry Girls</i>, was up for the challenge of leading a romantic storyline.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“With Penelope this season, it felt like there were so many things that were reflected in real life,” she told the <i>L.A.
