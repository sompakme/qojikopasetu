SpaceX had even encouraged the attendant to get a masseuse license.</p><p>When she arrived, the business mogul was “completely naked except for the sheet covering the lower half of his body,” as is standard — but things quickly took a disturbing turn when Musk removed the sheet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The billionaire then reportedly began touching the attendant without her consent</a>. While touching the woman’s leg, Musk reportedly offered to buy the attendant a horse—as the attendant was known to ride horses—if she would “do more.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elon Musk Gives Tesla Shares Worth $5.7 Billion To Charity</a></span></p><p>Following the incident, the attendant filed a complaint to SpaceX’s HR department in 2018. She claimed that her career at the space engineering company had suffered as a result of her refusing Musk’s advances. The company took the complaint to a mediator, and the attendant received a $250,000 severance agreement which barred her from saying anything negative about Musk or any of his companies—the agreement also prevented her from mentioning the payment itself.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After Insider broke the bombshell story</a>, the billionaire told the outlet that there was “a lot more” to the story and called it a “politically motivated hit piece.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He continued: "If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light," he wrote, calling the story a "politically motivated hit piece."</p><p>He later alluded to the story on Twitter—<a href=#>which he is currently in the process of purchasing</a>—repeating his belief that the attacks were political.</p><p>“The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech,” he tweeted.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Elon Musk Blocks Kid Who Asked For $50 Thousand To Stop Tracking His Jet</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAsa3Cnq9mmZyhsqixw6WwZqiRnrFufpRpZ2loXam8bq%2FOr5yrZaWleqa4zqdkpq2joMBuv8SxrJqkXaK2tK%2FOp5uum6Rk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./patrick-swayze-s-brother-don-swayze-wiki-bio-net-worth-wife-family.html><span>←</span><span>Patrick Swayzes brother, Don Swayze Wiki Bio, net worth, wife, family</span></a>
