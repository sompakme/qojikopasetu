I think he’s been extremely self-serving, has played the martyr role to a tee, and has for someone who, when I met the guy, and look, I got a lot of good things to say about parts of my relationship with him.</p><p>“He helped me in places when he didn’t have to; whether that was for his own good or not, I’m not entirely sure, but regardless, it helped me get where I needed to go and do the things I needed to do. And for a guy who, when I met him, kind of made it seem like he was all about giving back to the business. He really turned into a pretty selfish guy and really wanted to take more from the industry.</p><p>“And look, he said some really bad things about me. Talked down about me for years and the company for years. And I’m talking some really bad stuff, called me like a bootlicker and crap like that. And like, you don’t know me. You don’t know what I stand for. I’m a loyal person. And I just felt pretty insulted by a lot of the way he treated me, treated the place that I worked for, treated friends that I worked with.</p><h2 id=h-hey-colt-cabana-how-you-doing>“Hey, Colt Cabana, how you doing?”</h2><p>“I don’t need to get into any of the stuff with Colt Cabana if you want to go and look at that kind of stuff that’s out there. But yeah, I mean, just the way he treated people, the way I felt like he was only looking out for himself. And in the way he talked down about me and my friends and the people who are here putting the hard work in at WWE, trying to make this thing as good as we possibly could because we love the industry.</p><p>“We truly love it. Not just what it can do for us, but we actually love it, want to get back to it, and want to make it the best it can possibly be. And I always just felt like he was a fraud in that sense, or at least turned into one at some point in the last decade. And so yeah, that’s that’s the long of it. It’s a deep-rooted, I wouldn’t call it a hatred, but there’s a certain animosity there. No doubt about it.”</p><p><a href=#>Seth Rollins Regrets One Part Of His Reaction To CM Punk’s Return To WWE</a></p><p>What do you make of Seth Rollins’ comments?
