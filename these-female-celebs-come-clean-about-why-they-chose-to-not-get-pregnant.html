Even that is not easy for them. They need to think about their careers, images, and social life. They generally have to make plans before embarking on motherhood.</p><p>Another struggle of being a celebrity is that there is no personal life for them. Everything about their lives is publicized. So, if celebs lose a pregnancy, have fertility issues, or voluntarily choose not to conceive, people do not always give them space.</p><p>There was a time when such issues used to be called “ladies' troubles”. No one liked talking about them openly. However, these days, infertility, surrogacy, and other <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">matters related to pregnancy</a> are being discussed quite frankly, like other physical and mental health concerns.</p><p>Now, let's take a look at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these bold celebrities</a>,&nbsp;who have opened up about why they chose not to be pregnant:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katey-sagal><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Katey Sagal</span></h2><p>The talented actor became extremely popular in the 1980s, thanks to her on-screen character, Peg Bundy, from the hilarious comedy series, Married with Children.
