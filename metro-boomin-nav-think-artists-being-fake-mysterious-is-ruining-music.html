X users began naming artists that they felt Metro and NAV could be referring to, including Playboi Carti, Drake, Kendrick Lamar, DJ Khaled, and more. Some even called out Metro for once being “mysterious” himself.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Yo @playboicarti metro talking about you,” <a href=# rel=nofollow>replied one user</a> as <a href=# rel=nofollow>another also said</a>, “@playboicarti i hope you paying attention.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>A third user commented</a>, “is that why you haven’t collabed with carti recently.” Elsewhere, responses included, “<a href=# rel=nofollow>@djkhaled metro talking about you,</a>” “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Drake?</a>,” and “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Lool u digging Kendrick?</a>” However, Metro nor NAV responded to any of the commentary.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">One person took a dig at Metro, saying, “He used to be one of the MOST mysterious so I’m glad he’s coming out of that phase honestly.” Another replied to NAV, “After 10+ years of being mysterious LMAO. That’s hilarious. Don’t get me wrong I love metro, but he could go stream Fortnite for the rest of his life and all of his fans would still stick around.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He continued, “Easy to show every piece of you when you have no one criticizing and many people waiting to support any endeavor you pursue.

Beyoncé, Frank Ocean, and even André 3000, who just released his <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234823596>debut solo album New Blue Sun</a>, have all caught heat in the past for not being transparent about music.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In an April episode of Joe Budden’s podcast, the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234737476>rapper-turned media voice</a> called out Ocean, who he dubbed a “scammer.” Budden spoke on Ocean for eluding his Def Jam contract, not being clear about his music, headlining and then canceling his set at Coachella, and for simply not being fair to his fans and other artists.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He’s a scammer for the way he got out of <a href=# data-type=post data-id=644534>his [Def Jam] Universal contract</a>,” Budden started. “He’ll always wear the scammer tag&nbsp;for me. That f**ked up a lot of artists, he didn’t care. Lost a lot of artist revenue streams, took Apple out the game, he didn’t care.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Speaking of the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=514566>Coachella cancelation </a>and refusing to let fans know if new music was on the way, he added, “Everybody is here for your stupid a** who ain’t put out music in ages, and you can’t even confirm if there’s new music coming?! The arrogance of these ni**as, yo.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Blonde artist reportedly showed up to 2023 Coachella an hour late, leaving fans with a 90-minute lackluster set. Following the first weekend’s show, Ocean explained his reasoning for canceling his second performance. Ocean reportedly <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234750352>had an injury</a> that occurred on festival grounds ahead of the first weekend “due to two fractures and a sprain in his left leg.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He claimed that he was advised by medical professionals not to take the stage, although many did not buy his reasoning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6Kytb7OZpmop52eu26t0a2grKyjYrOit8RmpLKrpJq%2FqrvUrGSrrZmjtq%2BzjKasrKGTYn5zf5NxaWxwZGV8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-sosin-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Sosin Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
