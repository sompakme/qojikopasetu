Right, and that did not happen. I mean, I pretty much set up Harley and Austin. If you talk to them, they'll probably say the same thing.

I mean, I pretty much set up Harley and Austin. If you talk to them, they'll probably say the same thing. I facilitated that severely.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Playing matchmaker!</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Yes, absolutely. We were all staying in the same house. I could tell, I was like, "Oh my gosh," and they were playing love interests in the film. It was so serendipitous. I made it happen. Neither of them wanted to talk to each other, they were so scared, and I was like, "Mm-mm, you need to talk to her. You need to talk to him. He's feeling this way. She's feeling that way." Then, I became best friends with Harley, she's my sister. I seriously couldn't imagine my life without her. Cheyenne and Montse, same thing, I love those humans so much. I could go on and on all day about them.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>I'm happy to let you gush! I think that it's really incredible that not only were you able to personally connect with them, but that you were able to help them realize something that maybe they would've just brushed over and been like, "Oh, what if that had happened?"</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Right?!</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You got in there and you made sure.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Yeah, I'm pretty great. No, I'm just kidding.

I made that happen and I'm taking full credit for it.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>I think you should! I'm going to make that the headline of this piece. Focus on that, you know? Matchmaker of the century.</strong></p><p dir=ltr>Yeah!
