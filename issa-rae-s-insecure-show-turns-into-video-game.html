According to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, “The Come Up Game,” developed by <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Glow Up Games</a>, will transform the hit series’ characters into animated figures that can live the life you design for them, explore and unlock parts of Los Angeles that can help them advance, have an active dating life, and create something that’ll change your community for the better.</p><p>“When we approached&nbsp;Insecure, the stakes got high,” Latoya Peterson, Glow Up Games CXO, Director for the Culture, said. “You don’t see a lot of of-color IP being adapted into the game space. It doesn’t mean that shows like&nbsp;Girlfriends,&nbsp;Living Single, and&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;don’t deserve games. Or, you know,&nbsp;Atlanta&nbsp;or&nbsp;Black-ish. But they just don’t get them. We knew this was going to be a high-profile adaptation.”</p><p>Mitu Khandaker, Glow Up Game’s CEO, Director of Technoloy, said to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Teen Vogue</a> that this is a step in the right direction in promoting this form of storytelling in a video game format. “And that’s not even counting the enormous issue of representation in games. So, we were super excited for the opportunity to create&nbsp;<i>Insecure: The Come Up Game</i>, because it’s time that games did things differently and lifted up more black and brown women — as both playable characters, and behind the scenes, as developers.” Issa Dee’s classic mirror-freestyles will also be available for one’s own lyrical output.</p><p>“The Glow Up Games team has been amazing to work with and it was such a rewarding experience to create this game alongside an all women of color-led team,” Rae <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>.&nbsp;Insecure: The Come Up Game&nbsp;will be available for download in Apple’s App Store as well as Google Play later this year. In the meantime, watch season four’s trailer below ahead of its Apr. 12 release.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX52vsHnIp6qem6Wnsm6%2FxKugnqtdl7Kku8yeqmaumZmysHnGmqSeZWZshHp8lmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./don-cheadle-news-us-weekly.html><span>←</span><span>Don Cheadle News - Us Weekly</span></a>
