Now, she's carved her own lane for herself as in the art pop genre as one of most listened to singers in the game.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Steps Enrique Iglesias Took To Become The World's Top Latino Pop Star</a></span></p><h2 id=a-prot-g-is-born>A Protégé is Born</h2><p>Lorde was born&nbsp;Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor on November 7th, 1996 in Auckland, New Zealand. Some people may not be aware that her mother is acclaimed poet Sonja Yelich. Sonja went to great lengths to make sure her daughter was the brightest she could be. The lyrical singer's prowess that's garnered her the massive success she has to day can certainly be acquainted to the knowledge and culture passed onto her by her gifted mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I guess my mum influenced my lyrical style by always buying me books. She’d give me a mixture of kid and adult books too, there weren’t really any books I wasn’t allowed to read. I remember reading Feed by M.T. Anderson when I was six, and her giving me Salinger and Carver at a young age, and Janet Frame really young too," the singer recalls in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Magazine</a>, "We’d always discuss what I had read, which helped me form this really strong understanding of what I did and didn’t like about the ways different writers used words."</p><p>Her mother quickly found that she was a gifted child with exemplary intelligence. She spent a while at a school for the gifted. Though her mother pulled her out shorty after enrolling to put her in regular education system. During her formative years, she participated in speech and literature competitions. Though her true passion was, of course, music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It didn't take long for Lorde to begin her career as a musician. At the ripe age of only thirteen, she was signed to Universal Music Group after her father sent the record label a tape of her singing at a talent show.</p><p>"All I had was ‘the voice,’ I wasn’t looking for anything more," she tells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Music Connection</a>, "Universal just caught me at a very, very young age."</p><h2 id=the-song-that-started-it-all>The Song That Started It All</h2><p>UMG's executive producer&nbsp;Scott Maclachlan teamed the young singer with songwriter and former Goodnight Nurse front man Joel Little. They hit off right away and started churning out songs in Little's Auckland studio,&nbsp;Golden Age Studio. They spent three weeks working on their debut EP, Love Club.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We just got along really well, even outside of music, just chatting about stuff. It took us a couple of sessions before we even wrote a song really. We’d start ideas, but again it’s that thing of building a relationship so you feel comfortable to put your ideas forward," Little recalled in an interview with<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> NZ Musician</a>.</p><p>When they were ready to release the Love Club EP, Maclachlan was a bit skeptical about how well it would do. But his worries were quickly put to rest when the album was released in 2013 with rave reviews and thousands of downloads. The EP was a massive success, reaching the number 1 spot in New Zealand and Australia. Lorde's star quality was becoming increasingly apparent as she became the youngest singer to reach the #1 of Billboard's Hot 100 since the 1980's, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TIME</a>.</p><p>"It was such an era in my life," Lorde reflects in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple J</a>, "I was 16 to 18, which is such a pivotal time in everyone’s lives and mine was going to the Grammys, seeing all this crazy stuff, and the world being at my feet in this really exciting way. That will always be indelibly planted in my memory.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Royals went on to hold the number one spot for nine consecutive weeks and gained Lorde her first Grammy. Her seemingly overnight success lead her to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">signing a publishing deal </a>with Sony Entertainment that same year. The deal was worth $2.5 million!</p><h2 id=not-a-one-hit-wonder>Not a One Hit Wonder</h2><p>After Royals, Lorde went on to continue her journey towards stardom. She began collaborating with Fun's&nbsp; Jack Antonoff to create&nbsp;her second album Melodrama. Much like her debut album, Melodrama was an instant success. It granted the singer with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Grammy nomination for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Album of the Year</a>. She wrote the album in the halfway point between her teenage years and her impending adulthood. The music showcased her growing maturity as an artist, as well as a person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This year, she released a memoir entitled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Going South</a> which chronicles her long awaited trip to Antarctica. She's also&nbsp;raring up to release her highly anticipated third album, Solar Power,&nbsp;which will be available on August 20th.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Rihanna Is Officially A Billionaire</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Magazine</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NZ Musician</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TIME</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Triple J</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sL7DnmSsoZ6csrN5xaipra2emnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./miranda-cosgrove-and-jennette-mccurdy-both-struggled-with-nickelodeon-but-had-very-different-experi.html><span>←</span><span>Miranda Cosgrove And Jennette McCurdy Both Struggled With Nickelodeon, But Had Very Different Experi</span></a>
