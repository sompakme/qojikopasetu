However, when it comes to Pete Davidson, he is such an unlikely star that his ascent to fame is hard to believe at times. After all, at first blush, it easy to get the impression that Davidson is a slacker given the persona he has crafted over his years in the spotlight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter how Pete Davidson comes across at times, in reality, the guy has accomplished an awful lot and that is far from a coincidence. Clearly someone with work ethic, Davidson has given just about every avenue an entertainer can go down a try at one time or another. For that reason, he has amassed a sizable fortune despite his relatively young age.</p><p>While there is no way for the general public to know exactly how much money Pete Davidson has, according to several reports he has an estimated net worth of $6 million. Given the fact that Davidson is best known for his most high profile job, people may assume that his money came from that alone. However, in reality, Davidson has made money in a lot of different ways over the years. On top of that, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Davidson lives with his mother</a> to this day so that has to be saving him some kind of money, even though she moved into his home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Are Part Of Pete Davidson’s Circle (And 10 Who Stay Away)</a></span></p><h2 id=building-a-career>Building a Career</h2><p>If you are someone who hasn’t followed Pete Davidson’s career closely, it can be really easy to believe that his career was an overnight success story. After all, up until the moment he debuted on a major network show, mainstream audiences had absolutely no idea who he was. However, in reality, Davidson had been toiling away trying to find his breakout role for a long time before he found it.</p><p>Given the chance to debut on TV when he appeared in a pair of mostly forgotten MTV shows, showing up on Guy Code and Failosophy did nothing for Pete Davidson’s career. Still working hard to make his mark on the television landscape, Davidson landed a guest role on Brooklyn Nine-Nine and a starring role on a Fox pilot that wasn’t picked up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite Pete Davidson’s early TV failures, during that same time, he began to turn heads as a comedian. In fact, he garnered enough attention to appear in 6 episodes of Nick Cannon Presents: Wild 'N Out and he also received the chance to perform standup on a variety of shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s Why Nick Cannon Won’t Give Pete Davidson Dating Advice</a></span></p><h2 id=headline-grabber>Headline Grabber</h2><p>In this day and age, making money in the entertainment business takes a lot more than just landing high profile jobs. After all, when an actor is good in a show or movie but the masses aren’t paying attention, it is akin to a tree falling in a forest without anyone around to hear it. For that reason, any examination of how Pete Davidson has made his money must include a look at his history of garnering tabloid headlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most often in the paparazzi’s crosshairs due to the women he has been romantically involved with, the truth is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Davidson has dated several female stars who seemed out of his reach</a>. Most famously engaged to Ariana Grande for a few months in 2018, during their whirlwind relationship Davidson’s public profile went to a whole new level. Also linked to Kate Beckinsale and Kaia Gerber in the past, Davidson’s relationships never seem to last but the public often pays a lot of attention to them.</p><p>On top of the masses taking note of his love life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Davidson often has spoken freely about his struggles with his mental health issues</a>. In fact, it could easily be argued that Pete’s efforts to support other people who’ve dealt with similar issues are the most admirable things he’s ever done with his celebrity.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What It’s Like To Date Pete Davidson, According To His Exes</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=big-money-work>Big Money Work</h2><p>When Pete Davidson landed a relatively small role in the acclaimed more Trainwreck, he likely had no idea that it would be the key to him amassing a $6 million fortune. Given the chance to work with Bill Hader on that movie, Davidson clearly struck his much more famous co-star as particularly funny. After all, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Hader liked Pete Davidson enough to arrange for him to get a Saturday Night Live audition</a>.</p><p>Chosen to join Saturday Night Live’s cast, Pete Davidson debuted during the 2014 season and has continued to work on the show ever since. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reportedly paid $15,000 per SNL episode he appears in, Pete Davidson has made a lot of money working on that show</a>. On top of that, the fame that Davidson’s SNL tenure has earned him has given him a lot of other fiscally rewarding chances.</p><p>A good friend of veteran Saturday Night Live writer and comedian John Mulaney, in 2019 Pete Davidson and his buddy were paid a pretty penny to tour their “Sundays with Pete & John” comedy show. Also able to catch the eye of Hollywood powerbroker Judd Apatow, the two men crafted Davidson’s first starring movie vehicle, The King of Staten Island. On top of those high paying gigs, Davidson also is set to star in several other anticipated movies so his net worth is bound to take off even more in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bam Margera Used To Have A $45 Million Net Worth, Here’s What He Has Left Today</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinnqyVYrGiwsidqqimXaOytXnWqKmtoF1nfXN8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./48-extremely-flattering-one-piece-swimsuits-for-all-body-types.html><span>←</span><span>48 Extremely Flattering One-Piece Swimsuits for All Body Types</span></a>
