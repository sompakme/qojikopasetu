She’s also an OG Swiftie.</p><p>While Brittany Jade may classify herself as “your local emo girlfriend,” her music taste extends to the pop and country genres as well. Growing up in the southern region of the United States, Jade was introduced to country music at a young age. Despite being widely surrounded by the tunes of Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood, Jade took special interest in the music stylings of another artist — <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestleZone’s Ella Jay</a>, Brittany Jade opened up about her Taylor Swift fandom, which began amidst the release of Swift’s debut album.</p><p>“I was raised by a single father in the Deep South and obviously we grew up with country music. He’s a single father of all three daughters, like all women, so he wanted to get into more country female artists. As you know, he had daughters, so he wanted that representation for us. When we were growing up, this up-and-coming young country music star, so he was like, let me snag this Miranda Lambert. Let me snag this Carrie Underwood. Let me snag this Taylor Swift. And I guess Taylor Swift just resonated more with me,” Jade said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h2>Love For New Swifties</h2><p>“So, I had her first debut album, followed her throughout the years because I kind of grew up with her. Even though she’s almost a decade older than me, we all kind of grew up together because she was in the spotlight since 14, and each album I was just like, ‘Dang.’ I guess every feeling ever is kind of normal, no matter what platform you’re at. Even when it was trendy to hate her, I still liked her, and I defended her.”</p><p>“Now that it’s trendy to like her, everybody’s like, ‘Of course you like her.’ And I’m like, ‘I’ve been liked her.’ I love all the new Swifties, I love their passion, but it’s heartbreaking that all the girls in high school who made fun of me for defending Taylor Swift, especially the ones who were like, ‘Oh my God, I hate 1989,’ or the people that diss Reputation. I was just like, ‘No, I love it. It’s so good.’ All those people that made fun of me for liking Taylor got the tickets and I didn’t, and it’s not fair. It’s not fair.”</p><h3 id=h-favorite-t-swift-songs>Favorite T-Swift Songs</h3><p>As a long-time listener of Taylor Swift, Brittany Jade was asked to share her top three favorite songs of Swift’s. While her top two were easy to pinpoint, Jade settled on a tie for her third favorite Taylor Swift tune.</p><p>“I think number one coming in at all time is ‘Haunted’. Dang, this is hard. So ‘Haunted’ is at number one. At number two is actually going to be a little <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fearless</a> moment. I really like ‘Tell Me Why’. Nobody likes that song. Anytime I see them ranking it on TikTok, they put it last. I want to punch them in the throat, but I don’t,” Jade said. “It’s like tied between ‘New Year’s Day’ and ‘Mary’s Song’, now for number three.”</p><p>Of all the Taylor Swift eras, Jade seems to feel most connected to the Lover album, so naturally, she got a tattoo to commemorate it.</p><p>“I am a big Taylor Swift fan. I’ve been a Swiftie since 2008, not recent on the bandwagon here. But I got a ‘Lover’ tattoo for the Lover era because it’s probably my favorite. It’s just like a little lollipop that says ‘Lover’ in the Lover font. I love it a lot.”</p><p>Watch our full interview with Brittany Jade below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaJ6VlsG2vsSsZqKmpJq%2Ft7XEsKpoaWRlhXGAkWaZq6Gkqa6vxYyjmJ2dXZ7Abq3NZqagZaOstqfAyJ5ksJmeqcBuwM5mp66mk516tbHLpWSmnV2stbp5wqugraGTqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amid-the-danny-masterson-drama-this-is-how-laura-prepon-is-rising-above-the-scandal.html><span>←</span><span>Amid The Danny Masterson Drama, This Is How Laura Prepon Is Rising Above The Scandal</span></a>
