So far, it seems to be working well, as Patrick Schwarzenegger's net worth is already impressive for someone who, thanks to family money, probably never had to work if he didn't want to.</p><h2 id=patrick-is-more-than-just-arnold-schwarzenegger-39-s-son>Patrick Is More Than Just Arnold Schwarzenegger's Son</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/bella-thorne-and-patrick-schwarzenegger-in-midnight-sun.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most biographies of Patrick Schwarzenegger start out by describing him as the son of <a href=#><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong></a> and Maria Shriver. While that's true, <a href=#>Patrick hasn't relied on his parents' fame to build his career</a> in Hollywood. At least, it doesn't appear that way.</p><p>Rather than follow in his father's Terminator footsteps, Patrick started working in Hollywood with very different gigs. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His acting debut was in 2006</a>, when he was about 13, when he was a random "jock kid" in The Benchwarmers.</p><p>After that, things were quiet for Patrick until his next gig in 2012, where he played a minor character in the Kristen Bell-supported Stuck in Love. The film also featured Greg Kinnear, Jennifer Connelly, and Lily Collins.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>15 Facts About Patrick Schwarzenegger And Miley Cyrus' Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Next, Patrick appeared in an Ariana Grande music video, of all things, and then started appearing in other projects like a zombie apocalypse film and the TV series Scream Queens. More recently, Patrick has landed more significant gigs, including eight episodes each on shows like The Long Road Home and The Staircase and a recurring gig on The Terminal List (with his brother-in-law Chris Pratt).</p><p>In 2018, Patrick starred alongside Bella Thorne in the movie Midnight Sun; it wasn't exceptionally well-received by viewers, but working with Bella, who was previously a Disney darling and is still a big name today, might have given Patrick's resume a boost.</p><p>Now, perhaps his most anticipated gig is as Golden Boy, a superhero from the world of The Boys, in Gen V. A September 2023 series premiere on Amazon Prime could give Patrick the visibility he needs to build an impressive career in Hollywood.</p><p>To date, of course, his gigs have been relatively minor, as evidenced by his current net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=patrick-schwarzenegger-39-s-net-worth-is-about-8-million>Patrick Schwarzenegger's Net Worth Is About $8 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/patrick-schwarzenegger-in-an-interview.jpg><p>As of 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Schwarzenegger's net worth is said to be $8 million</a>. That might seem like pennies for the son of famed Terminator Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose <a href=#>net worth hit $450 million and was still rising</a> going into 2023.</p><p>Patrick might be in line for some family money, and he probably didn't have to get a regular job, as most celebrity kids don't, but he's working on building a career all his own. And while not all of <a href=#>Arnold's other kids' net worths</a> are public, Patrick may have the highest of them all.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Arnold Schwarzenegger Spend A Fortune Trying To Keep His Love Child With Maid Mildred Baena Secret From His Wife?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, on her own, is worth less than her little brother at $3 million. She's married to multi-millionaire Chris Pratt, of course, but on her own, Katherine hasn't built up quite as illustrious a career just yet.</p><p>But despite Patrick's successes in Hollywood and regarding his finances, it's unclear what kind of price his acting fetches, and whether the family name helps or hurts. Patrick doesn't seem to be looking for Arnold-inspired gigs, as evidenced by his appearance in a teen romance movie and various TV shows lacking any robotic mercenaries.</p><h2 id=patrick-schwarzenegger-runs-various-businesses>Patrick Schwarzenegger Runs Various Businesses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/patrick-schwarzenegger-promoting-mosh.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Patrick has also picked up some side gigs, including one with his mom. In a March 2023 Instagram post, Patrick and his mom Maria appeared in a promotional video for Mosh Life, their shared business venture.</p><p>The business was relatively new when Patrick and Maria shared that their product had made it onto store shelves, but it's not the only thing Patrick has been working on.</p><p>He also models, including for Hugo Boss and other brands, and has appeared in various magazines as both a model and interview subject. Modeling seemingly came naturally for Patrick, who even launched his own clothing line as a teen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Do Arnold Schwarzenegger's Pet Donkey, Pig, Dogs, And Horse Live More Lavishly Than His Own Children?</a></span></p><p>While that arguably required some investment from his parents, Patrick doesn't seem content to sit back and rely on his family's money or fame to get him work. He also dabbles in real estate, buying homes, working on them a bit, and then reselling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His real estate margins weren't massive, but Patrick seems to enjoy working on properties, and it's unclear whether he currently owns a home or possibly rents. What is known is that he lives with his long-time girlfriend, model Abby Champion.</p><p>Abby features in Patrick's Instagram posts, and though the two haven't announced an engagement, they seem very serious and have been since 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinmqyinrCsedKcn7CZoq%2Byr7HGoJyrZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-middleton-s-family-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Middleton's Family Net Worth</span></a>
